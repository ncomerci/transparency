Link to our website https://cenmodels.com\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years. We sincerely love games and our work. A year ago, we started to see the potential in Decentraland. We studied the specifics of Decentraland and spent thousands of hours at work. And now, when we know we can create high-quality content, we turn to DAO, to people who believe in the success of Decentraland as much as we do and who, like us, want to participate in its development. We know it is only the beginning of our great journey in improving the Decentraland.\n \n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland, which will entail its advancement.\n \n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won't be a 100% copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics for several reasons:\n- Specifics of computer games. \n- Limitations of Decentraland. \n- Rules that are easy to understand. Even if you didn't play games like D&D before. \nOther reasons.\n\n\nExamples of different game mechanics:\n- A session in D&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n- An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n- Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating them themselves.\n\n \nExpenditure of funds:\n- Purchasing a 2x3 land to place the game on it. To date, the cheapest 2x3 plots are in this price range. People who have made content for Decentraland or have some knowledge about Builder know that acceptable values for triangles, materials, textures, and so on depend on the number of adjacent sections. The 2x3 plot is the minimum size to make beautiful and diverse models of characters, scenery, effects, and other things. (22 000 - 30 000$)\n\n- Programmer's salary. A programmer is one of the most important specialists in game development. (16 000 - 18 000$)\n\n- The salary of two 3d artists. Our modelers face a difficult task. They need to meet the scene's limitations but, at the same time, make a lot of diverse, maximally optimized models. (14 000 - 16 000$)\n\n- Game designer's salary. The game designer will have to think through all the game mechanics and assemble them into a single whole. (8000 - 10 000$)\n\n- Gamemaster's salary. As I said before, our team is big fans of D&D, but we decided to call a professional for the role of the gamemaster. The gamemaster will create 2 intriguing game scenarios with many ramifications and a variety of game passing. They will come up with characters, their personalities, the world and the laws by which they live, and much more. (4000 - 5000$)\n\n- Artist's salary. The artist will draw hero cards, interfaces, backgrounds, and so on. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Sound designer's salary. Audio is a crucial component of the atmosphere for better immersion. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Other expenses. Various services, servers, etc. (5 000$)\n\n- Marketing. We will cover this amount using our own funds. We need to make a statement! (10 000 - 12 000$)","specification":"First, the gamemaster and the game designer will create the game's foundation. They'll decide which mechanics to replicate from D&D, which to change, and which to add. They'll develop 2 adventure scenarios and think through all the dialogues, the variability of actions, characters, etc.\n Then they split into two teams:\n1) The gamemaster will start working with an artist, a sound designer, and one of the 3d artists. This team will be responsible for the lore of the game, its appearance, and its sound.\n2) The game designer will work with a programmer and a second 3d artist. Their main task will be to make gameplay and smart objects.\nEven though they'll divide into two other teams, both groups will work closely to ensure that all aspects of the game are compatible.\n\n\nHow we see the final result (in short):\nEach player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences. The characters get into some situations and receive a task. For example, players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf. The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions (\"Inspect the tavern,\" \"Approach the tavern and start talking to him\"...). Some actions' success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, in \"Strike a stealthy attack at a robber,\" - you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is, for example, 10; you roll the dice, if <10 falls out - you missed, >10 - you hit. In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players' characters have died.\nFor a complete understanding, check out D&D if you don't know what kind of game it is.\n\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.","personnel":"- Programmer.

This is what DCL set out to do, co-create the Metaverse, but believe there can be more contributors to the Metaverse puzzle. \n\nOur guiding compass is to encourage architecture in the Metaverse and to develop a new economic model for architects/3D designers in the process of architecting the Metaverse. With an active influx of high-quality buildings to DCL there will be more experiences for users rather than vast areas of barren land. We are also confident that monthly user adoption and user-generated events will also rise. For such a task to occur we need to revolutionise the way the marketplace, builder and SDK currently operate. \n\nRenovi believes that to build further, more complex and enticing experiences within DCL the correct stakeholders need to be rewarded for creating. This implies that high-quality, professional architects/3D designers but also upcoming talent needs to be interested and more importantly motivated to create for the Metaverse. \n\nArchitects/3D Designers can now break their real-life moulds and find new monetary avenues by leveraging their efforts for exponential development through DCL. \n\nFollowing on from our successful poll “Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?” (Link: https://bit.ly/3P1dybU) we have taken onboard the feedback from the various stakeholders and revised our approach to offer a better solution. \n\nWe aim to create cross-platform compatible 3D asset NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. We want to create a seamless experience in which a creator can upload a 3D asset in Renovi Marketplace (or any other marketplace) and put it for sale. Consequently the buyer of that 3D asset now an NFT will be able to navigate directly from the marketplace to the DCL builder in which they can find the asset as a new asset pack. Within a few clicks, they should be able to place the asset on their land and if further alterations are required they can download the scene so it can be altered on the SDK. \n\nTo achieve this we will integrate the Renovi marketplace to DCL by building part of the DCL API links so that 3D assets are compatible and can be presented in the builder as long as they belong to the respective user’s wallet. This will enable us to automate the current procedure. Currently, the buyer of a 3D asset needs to download it and reupload it to the builder while at the same time there is no clear way of ensuring they are the owners of that building as an NFT. We will offer a single, simple streamlined solution for DCL.\n\nAs part of giving back to the community, we will also need to ensure that there is API compatibility between DCL products and Renovi Marketplace or any other marketplace. We want to make it possible that everyone who purchases a 3D asset as an NFT that is compatible with DCL can connect their wallet, navigate to the builder of DCL and be able to find the respective 3D asset as an external asset pack that can be placed on their land.\n\nOur goal is to automate the implementation pipeline, and indirectly add buildings as NFTs into DCL by opening up the builder and its capabilities to a wider audience.\n\nWebsite: https://renovi.io  \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/eMEPwxCyEk  \n\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3P3MNn2","specification":"How can we achieve this?\n\nTo achieve a technical specification of this magnitude, we will need to carefully craft and technically architect each stage of our infrastructure and execution. This will entail developing an API, which we will label as the “industry standard” prototype for interoperable communication. Developing a standard will be subject to outlining in full, all parameters that are currently present within DCL technical ecosystem. E.g. project name, parcel type, parcel dimensions, file type, price, chain, triangles, materials, meshes, bodies, entities and textures etc. \n\nThis will be followed by documentation, enabling a user to educate themselves on creating GET/POST requests to and from the Renovi and DCL ecosystems. All API calls will be open and provided to the public to interact with. We will allow users to obtain authentication mechanisms in the form of bearer tokens, from us, which can be invoked/revoked at any time, to facilitate the usage of our API. Upon integration and authentication, with industry standards, the user will be able to interact with the API to either fetch, embed, post, and/or utilise all the parameters available for each Metaverse asset.\n\nAt MVP stages, these interactions will bypass through a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) built on NodeJS and/or equivalent, as this enables us to interact with the blockchain using web3 infrastructure. Once an API request is authenticated and a user has posted their metaverse asset for approval, their user ID, wallet ID and asset ID will be manually (at first) approved and sent to the DCL builder. The CMS will enable any admin to utilise the CRUD convention (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) along with import/exporting any assets needed, to open communication lines between the CMS and the DCL builder. This could function in a similar way to approving DCL wearables.\n\nSome of our previous work creating for DCL \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/13Zxq0vEFG0wY_wn9ivqAcsexGbKrhzcK/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5WstmHEmTw4wGQQir92j52v-qVwiVc1/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1QPiPG53ucwWgdLyakvIwBRVxTDGgq7Q3/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10XSz4_MWEJDuOhNyhkFdVLvtqXaZArUg/view?usp=sharing","personnel":"Jacob Papageorgiou - CTO/ Co-Founder of Renovi together with a team of 6 talented full-stack web, DevOps, blockchain engineers and 2 UIUX Designers under his management will be able to execute these goals promptly. \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-papa/ \n\nhttps://github.com/mostmojo \n\nIn the last decade, Jacob has led teams in the U.S and U.K and has worked alongside developers of the likes of TransferWise & Revolut. \n\nHe's been a Technical Advisor to Blockchain and Private Equity startups and has led tech teams with clients of the likes of Nike, Vodafone, Adidas, National Lottery, Gordon Ramsay and UCL. \n\nHe has been a fellow educator for Brixton-based code camps and global leading tech boot camp Le Wagon, before founding Mojo Digital of which he has a client base of over 300 web applications/sites to date before co-founding Renovi. \n\nAdditionally, he’s been on the board of Coin Mara, an African Startup as a Technical Architect, that raised over $30M from Coinbase Ventures, Huobi and more.","roadmap":"Create a cross-platform connection for 3D assets that are NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. \n\nRebuild part of Decentraland’s existing builder so that 3D Assets that are NFTs can flow directly from marketplaces to the DCL builder.\n\n40K 4 months\n\nBuild an API layer of communication enabling the user to transfer NFTs from a marketplace to a DCL builder.\n\n34K 3 months\n\nEnsure API compatibility between DCL products, Renovi Marketplace but also other marketplaces such as Opensea.

Compatibility with digital fashion is the holy grail of this task. NFT technology promises interoperability, but all games/metaverses/apps have different avatars, graphic styles, and poly-counts for assets. There is no standard. So we also have multiple 3D files for each digital outfit. In order to support “interoperability” companies drop separate NFTs compatible with different metaverses. They are not linked. It is just creating a new copy of the design. None of them are compatible. They are not very useful for use outside of the platform on which they were created, and duplicating designs for portability to different worlds blurs the ownership, value and uniqueness of assets. \n\nSolution: \nWe’ve built an infrastructure that allows a single EVM-compatible asset to be worn not only in the game marketplace it was bought in, but in all worlds, everywhere it goes it converts to the appearance of the platform it’s in. We tap into the backend of metaverse marketplaces to make these assets tradable in-game. On the contrary of our competitors, who drop separate NFTs compatible for the different virtual worlds, our infrastructure does not create a duplicate of NFTs. Each 1 NFT works as an access pass to the compatible version of 3D asset for multiple metaverses/games/VR/AR/Zoom filters etc.\n\n\nDecentraland have been the first who started to support linked wearable, but our project serves to extend this capability to many other worlds and provide single window for the users/brands/metaverses.","specification":"We have described our tech in the following article: https://medium.com/gravity-the-studio\n\nOur demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNAj7YMWpSo&t=1s \nOur website:  https://gravitylayer.io\nGithub: https://github.com/Gravity-Studio-Digital-Wear\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gravitylayer/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GravitySkins\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Ejh4jEPRDC\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravitylayer/","personnel":"Our team for now consist of 10 full time team members and 2 ongoing freelancers.\nOur CEO and co-founder background is in ad agencies, her master’s research was in 3D fashion and digital identity.

Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.\n\nMetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.\n\nOur intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale.

The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.\n\nWe will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.\n\nOur servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.\n\nWe plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.\n\nOur goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:\n\n![ZenGarden by Dutchtide!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-ukbQAoh7USitMFCzs8C13fUd6PW9PhY \"ZenGarden by Dutchtide\")\n\n![metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lX7UaWfZR32JsFIaUcwTqVM4xIfGM9_ \"metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5\")\n\n![Creature House by Mila Lolli!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-p8jY6yd64irLt4tY3kqC5Hx5O9wQLoK \"Creature House by Mila Lolli!\")","personnel":"**Mark** - Co-founder - Serial tech entrepreneur - launched multiple platforms to empower architects, designers and creators.

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL.

We also know that there's a lot of work to be done to get there.\nThis proposal is our first step towards that vision.\n\n### Vision\nWe would love to see a thriving community of Decentraland game creators enabled by an ecosystem of tools that support them. Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.\nThe long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.\nTo achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.\n\n![Pixel art character concept art](https://d3da1k6uo8tbjf.cloudfront.net/edd84342-f714-11ec-8fd8-b2d1a80aa527?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22PixelArtCharacter%20Presentados.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27PixelArtCharacter%2520Presentados.png&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAS5PME4CT5QW2PJJU%2F20220628%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220628T204139Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c436f20009faf4e0ef686af1913333050cc54a4c078150cb4cc1c27a2f163974&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kM2RhMWs2dW84dGJqZi5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9lZGQ4NDM0Mi1mNzE0LTExZWMtOGZkOC1iMmQxYTgwYWE1Mjc~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_&Signature=qNUO6ENCDRXzJZGNR2al2iXX7u10HSsaaPB0N0mam-l~LmIUByjxSL5cNrViDmxLbAy32rTPJRYXUK44QR51puMUAvkl0C6DOUJGcCVJ7YH7H6nW-6HFxqgbTeuiVW0NESrBzP4i85kJovCeIa0E5dqeGcFndlG0STktmb07DeLANrPY25kcxxPlL7p7E6TwP8dA7ImMaSOL0LeA76Lq6MAwnSOlsPiaSBCIlZwbsHxzNxSjENh1MiyOGnAXKTodCuhSwhk-636A-HCk4PIaHrVplCbEjR6sioO65jYhtYubmwjHIbW36IoqlPCnyk7Z4gZq5BFa63YXvo7etyjREA__&Key-Pair-Id=K2BMZZDBFKKL41)","specification":"In order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.\n\nYou may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.\n\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700_3735892699868507_512428938455866077_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s640x640&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna&oh=00_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA&oe=62C136F0)\n\nThe main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:\n1. An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.\n2. A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).\n3. The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.\n4. A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.\n5. Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.\n\nWith these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.\n\nAs a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.\n\nOut of scope for this prototype:\n\n* Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).\n* Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.\n* Implementing a 2D sample game.","personnel":"**[frantufro](https://frantufro.com)** is a game and software developer with 20 years of experience and the owner and director of [Hidden People Club](https://hiddenpeople.club), a small game development team located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In a classic version of the game, win conditions are met by eliminating the opponent group. But we want to make it possible to join a game instance that has already started.","specification":"Game mechanic\n\nMinimum is 4 players. A game is usually played by 7-16 people. With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning. For this version 4 players for a start should be enough.\nA player get near a table, click on it, gets a message in a window if he is able to join a game instance. Users are able to join during a certain phase of the game. If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.\n\nZero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K \nWhere M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.\nFirst phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.\nSecond phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.\nThen everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.\n\nIf a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.\n\nAfter the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.\n\nNew players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.\n\nIf within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThis project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.\nVoting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.\nWe plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene.","personnel":"We are M-social Production, web and web3 developers, we have been doing digital projects since 2008.\nThere will be 4 people engaged in development:\n - Frontend dev\n - Backend dev\n - QA specialist\n - Project manager\n\nIf you want to know more about our experience, you can visit our website: https://msocialproduction.com","roadmap":"We expect a working alpha to be done within 3 weeks.\nWithin 2 weeks, we plan to make the functional code.

Then the electricity consumed is evaluated in the different location. This energy calculation should include the end user device, the networking and the servers of the metaverse. \nOnce the energy is evaluated for each location (granularity of a country), a new NFT is created including the extract of all the related certificate based on the preferred energy type (e.g. wind, solar…).","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":49997,"beneficiary":"0x73c4914A6Ec3E450A52B90bd7fe73929ABC0241a","description":"The grant will be used for standardizing the current API of NRverse for Decentraland purpose. The ultimate goal would be to offer seamless \"Decentraland Green Option\" or DGO in Decentraland platform for running on green electricity any land, event or user experience. This will mean that each time the DGO is activated each related electricity consumption around the world will be backed by renewable energy. \nFor doing so we will need to adapt the modules of NRverse to Decentraland specific parameters, we talk about: the calculator and the tokenizer of Renewables Energy Certificate and finally the interface. \n\n1) Calculator: First, and most important, is to develop the proper calculator modules adapted to Decentraland reality. \n1.1) Evaluation of electricity consumption: The electricity consumption is coming from multiple source: the end user device, the networking, the server of Decentraland. \nFor each of these electricity consumption centers, 2 aspects must be evaluated: the location and the amount of electricity during a certain period. In that context the project will develop a specific calculator based on the data from each user (IP address, wallet information, browser...) but also based on Decentraland servers data. \n\n1.2) Listening to Decentraland through SDK: Then the calculator will need to interface with the current Decentraland SDK to evaluate specific land information (e.g. amount of users, wallet information, transaciton happening...)\n\n-> The result of this should evaluate in real time the worldwide consumption of electricity of the activity on the land (e.g. parcel 45,62 consuming during last hour 30kWh in Germany, 1300 MWh in US, 48 kWh in Brazil...). \n\n2) Renewables Energy Certificate tokenizer: afterwards the amount of energy that is calculated needs to be extracted from existing Green certificate and tokenized into one NFT. \n2.1) Tokenizer: We need to create the smart contract that will generate the NFT including all the extract from  the different guarantee of origin. \n2.2) Update REC mother contract: We need to implement the logic that will update the smart contract that is containing the different original Renewables Energy Certificate (these are tokenized initially from a PDF coming from trusted issuers all over the world). \n\n3) User Interface: Second the interface for proposing Decentraland decarbonization services will be built. It includes a portal for organizing event (for corporate for example), the renting of Land. This will include partnership with player like moonbash and MGHDAO.\n\nUltimately we should have on one side an API that could be offer to anybody that wants to integrate in its land automated decarbonization and on the other side a portal that can help any participant, land owner to initiate the decarbonization of a land (continuously) or a simple event. On top we could include this certification explicitly into some ticket that can take any form of collectible.","specification":"1) The first capability of the product has been developed (in beta): upload the pdf Renewables Energy Certificate and transform them into an NFT.\nIn that process, the PDF's (from the initial Renewable Energy Certificate - REC) are parsed and data are stored in IPFS, they are then signed via Verifiable Credential thanks to the wallet of the REC's supplier (here metamask). The interface is to upload the data is a simple webpage. The NFT is then generated and transferred tot he wallet of NRverse. \nThe current chain used is Ethereum testnet because VC's / DiD are not available on polygon yet but that could be derived easily based  open source code from EWF (https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry) which was used by the team in the past in other projects. There is a full documentation about the API and the process which could be put at disposal.\n\n2) We need now to create the calculator capability for Decentraland and the related activities. This module will be most likely developed in javascript and will start by the evaluation of ethereum transaction notably based on McDonald calculation (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-emissions/blob/main/input/extra_data_label_regex.json ). \nFor the first version of the calculator the use in Decentraland will be based on benchmark as: laptop/desktop consumption, server consumption and networking from similar game and well as studies. Some details of technology architecture from Decentraland (servers, databases...) would help to evaluate more accurately the energy consumption. \nFor accurate calculation of an event or activity on a land the SDK of Decentraland will be used. Some advanced functionalities as conditional access to a parcel will also be used for specific event organisation for example. Another important interface will be the marketplace as certificate could be integrated as metadata of NFT to incentivize the explicit choice of participating to an event based on renewable energy. \n\n3) The last capability to develop will be the tokenizer module that will aggregate the NFT containing all the extract of the Renewables Energy Certificates will be developed in Polygon. \nThe wallet to be used will as well be Metamask and the payment will be managed in Mana.","personnel":"The project will be elad by Kai & Loic co-founder of NRverse and by their partners from BloxMove, MGH DAO and Lineup.\n\nKai Schmied is engineer with 10 years of experience in energy including 4 years fo experience in managing blockchain project in the context of the energy sector.

Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.​\n​\n\nWe propose creating a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL, which will help the DCL community to stand out on the metaverse platforms since this creation will be the first significant symbolic representation within the four major metaverse platforms. We believe that Web3.0 will enable the mascot to work even more functionally. The reasons are as follows.​\n​\n\nFirst and foremost, a DCL Mascot is a powerful marketing tool as it makes it easier for DCL to create a physical and emotional connection with every member. We think that because Web3.0 community members are from all over the world and in most cases, they don't have the opportunity to meet each other face to face, it has become harder for them to generate a sense of belonging. However, with the help of a mascot and more varied promo campaigns, DCL can easily bring the whole community together. For example, mascot costumes can be designed for members to wear in metaverse events, which will go a long way to making DCL members stand out and feel proud of their identities.​\n​\n\nWhat's more, the mascot will give DCL a competitive advantage on social media as followers are more likely to engage with the digital mascot. From Twitter pages to DCL experiences, a mascot can appear on various platforms. Mascot memes can also be created for DCL members to use on every platform.​\n​\n\nLast but not least, the DCL Mascot will be a memorable IP.​\n​\n\nThe BEAM Studio Team and any additional designers will work closely together to develop a first-of-its-kind Mascot with a unique personality, interactivity, and emotional support.","specification":"To begin this project, we will create a survey to collect DCL community members' opinions about the mascot and analyze the common traits within the community to decide on a mascot form that will perfectly represent the spiritual core of the community. This grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what they stand for.​\n​\n\nOne key part of this project is to design the virtual character of the mascot. We will use AI, C4D, AE, and other design tools to produce digital work. If it's a human or animal mascot, we will design its facial expressions, clothing, colour schemes, etc. If it's an object mascot, we will focus on how to convey the community spirits through this item with a combination of visuals and metaphors.​\n​\n\nBefore finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and colour schemes. We plan to design mascot-related memes and motions in the future and plan to release these memes and motions on our discord server. The avatars of the community administrators will all be replaced by mascots, and information about the mascot will be posted in the server's announcement. We promise that we will promote Mascot not only on our Discord server but also on our other official social media accounts, such as WeChat, Twitter, etc. Through our vigorous promotion, people will greatly increase their awareness of the mascot, and the image of DCL's mascot will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When people see the mascot, they will think that it represents DCL.​\n​\n\nFinally, the launch of the DCL Mascot could be coupled with a marketing project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes to Decentraland as possible with this mascot. This will bring the potential impact of DCL on the metaverse, with the aim of further encouraging the adoption of Decentraland, highlighting how it brings the community together and enables DCL users to fund projects that they have faith in.","personnel":"The proposed team of the Decentraland Mascot is the following:​\n\nMori:​\nCrypto artist, senior visual designer & freelance illustrator.

The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:\n- Metaverse journalism\n- Media DAOs\n- Decentralized tools for journalists\n- Token Funding\n- Token-gated content\n- Token incentives for collaborators\n\nThe plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics. Potential candidates are:\n\n- Laurent Bainier - [20mint.fr](https://20mint.xyz/) Web3 project from the french magazine 20minutes\n- KevinOnEarth - [Decentraland Report](https://xpand.gg/community/the-decentraland-report)\n- Reporters without borders - [Uncensored Library Project](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en) ([Grant funded](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) by Decentraland DAO)\n- [Tinshui Yeung](https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/tinshui-yeung) - ICFJ Fellow researching web3 journalism\n- Know someone who is doing cool stuff around web3, metaverses, and journalism? Let us know in the comments!\n\n\n### Why this event?\n\nHosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.\n\nSome of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.\n\n### Why the Decentraland DAO?\n\nLet's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.","specification":"The total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**\n\nBudget breakdown\n\n![budget-breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bmPZjUm.png)","personnel":"[Gino Cingolani](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani) (Decentraland DAO / Media Party)\nDecentraland Governance Squad Product Lead, Media Party Line-up Programmer. \n\n[Maggie Farley](https://twitter.com/maggilista) (ICFJ)  \nICFJ Director of Knight Fellowships.

The Decentraland wearable creation process currently has a steep learning curve for non-technical 3D artists who want to express themselves or facilitate a brand experience. 2D artists currently are completely dependent on 3D artists to be included into the ecosystem; an inadvertent gate set up by the current wearables submission paradigm.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, non-3D-proficient submissions often lead to delays in the curation process as multiple rounds of submissions and back-and-forth between the curation committee can occur before a final design is honed and approved. This excessive iteration could lead to delays for brand items to be ready for events on time, but also strains the wearable-curation committee as the submission fee does not account for the time the experts ultimately spend reviewing. \n\n### Solution:\n\nWear Essentials will provide a platform for aspiring wearables creators to design wearables without technical barriers. An easy to navigate user experience will allow creators to upload a 2D image and see their graphic presented on a catalog of essential wearables in real time. The solution will then manage the submission and curation process, deploy the wearables, and provide analytics with feedback about their uptake and distribution. \n\nUpon submission to the wearables committee - an action which will be available right in the platform - the whole process of deployment and royalty management can be handled. Through use of payment splitter contracts on polygon, an allocation of creator funds raised through primary and secondary sales can be shared with the DAO.\n\nThe collection of templates can also be expanded over time in partnership with brands and organizations.\n\nIt makes it easier for creators as the platform will provide a set of guardrails to produce quality wearables. A set of template wearables - hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes - provide a foundation to ensure the end result will have the correct poly-counts and vertex weighting. Creators can then upload 2D imagery to be mapped on the templates. Users only need to make choices on template color and placement/size of the 2D image content to result in a wearable ready for submission to the committee. This opens up the whole ecosystem to 2D artists (illustrators, graphic designers, tattoo and traditional). \n\nIt reduces the burden on the DAO Wearables Committee as submissions coming direct from the platform have less for the team to review. Confident that the poly-counts and assets are templated, the focus can then be placed on the guidelines for the 2D images that users uploaded (approved content, IP-infringement issues, etc…). \n\nIt will increase revenue to the DAO in a few ways. Through the simplification of the wearables submission process, this platform may lead to an increase in submissions to the DAO.

Lightspeed Graphics was launched in 2017 to create multimedia digital video experiences, commercial advertising, and graphic design, and would like to be the first to develop a new and exciting animated attraction within Decentraland.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics team believes in the need to bring Virtual Reality and storytelling as a truly rewarding and engaging experience to face challenges like user adoption, market size capture, and player satisfaction or retention among many other determinants. The VR industry will become more prevalent and interconnected to metaverse web3 applications as we reach mass adoption in the coming years and as new projects make their own unique metaverse-like experience. \n\nThe idea was inspired by the classic Ride Simulator Attractions seen at amusement parks, exhibits or tech museums that have been enjoyed for generations. We believe bringing this ride simulator experience into the metaverse will help bring value to Decentraland and help transition real world attractions or experiences into a connected metaverse experience.\n\nVeteran players and new players from AR/VR users, gamers, developers, film industry specialists, MX specialists and quite possibly well-known companies like Dynamic Attractions are all part of the target audience as we carve a space for VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attractions.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics Team and any additional contractors will work closely together to develop a first of its kind Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction with a complete narrative storyline, interactivity and future multiplayer experience.","specification":"The VR/Desktop Ride simulator will be accessible to the public and be distinguishable by the ‘Jump 2 Lightspeed’ logo. The size will need to be at least a 3x3 estate. The first adventure will be completely free to the public to ride indefinitely and be a learning experience for returning and new users to Decentraland. A crafting system will guide players to create unique wearables, in-game items and trade systems. Later, story add-ons called ‘Arcs’ will be gated by an initial purchase of an NFT, tickets, or subscription.\n\nOnce the Player has been granted access and has clicked the Ride Simulator, they are transported to a fixed chair position with the user’s perspective locked to the view of their avatar, while other avatars can be seen filling empty chair slots, (multiplayer experience), as the ride makes its final countdown to launch. Sponsored videos (will play during the countdown process to and promote other adventures, events, and activities throughout DCL.\n\nOnce the countdown has completed, no other players can join that adventure instance at this point. The lights dim and the animated adventure on screen begins playing.\nThe user has the option to enter fullscreen and see the entire video experience with a full monitor takeover, while the Oculus Headset user is now able to do a full headset takeover. \nThe game itself will feel like a rollercoaster ride through space, complete with narrative, voice over performances. Future development will bring the ability to fire and aim at targets with the mouse or Oculus controllers, making it a complete interactive game.","personnel":"Lightspeed Graphics:\nKirk Gonzales (CEO / Lead Designer)\nTwitter Handle: @AnmtrKirk\nLinkedin: linkedin.com/in/kirkgonzales\n\nAbout Me: I attended college for a B.A. from 2007 to 2011 in film and video production to learn everything needed behind movies, visual journalism and music videos.

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND! That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL. \nThe 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)\n- 1.5k per month for marketing \n- 2.5k per month for development","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.

The wearables on the shop will benefit the players during the P2E. Perks will include power-ups and game avatars(Avatar Swap). This will raise the value of those NFTs, their ownership, the project and Decentraland.\n\n\nSkatepark P2E:\n\nPlayers will have tokens to collect, obstacules and enemies to avoid, compete for top scores, win prizes, use NFTs and enjoy a skateboarding game in Decentraland.\nSkatepark, characters, avatars and assets can be changed according to events, seasons and tournaments. This will allow other projects to join and give the opportunity for their communtities to experience NFT ownership utility, which will bring more traffic and value to Decentraland simultanously.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby. Inside the skatepark,the user can log in and play. There will be rounds of 3 minutes to catch a limited amount of tokens, enemies to avoid and diferent levels to unlock.\n\n\nClub:\n\nA place for events and promotional content, where users can join, hang out and celebrate. NFTs can be displayed and purchased, users can learn more about Decentraland, NFT utility, web3, watch in-game and IRL competitions, interviews, streamings, videos and interact with assets. \nWe will utilize this feature to bring more projects to decentraland and experience the metaverse, by offering a space where they can find their target costumers and give more utility possibilities to their community members and customers. \nThe skatepark and stage assets, characters and gallery can be customized. We are ready to host events, create avatars, wearables, assets and promotional content.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby or skatepark.\n\nHow will it be sustainable?\n\nOur plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more wearables for decentraland with game features will bring more value to the NFTs and Decentraland. \nThere are many people interested in skateboarding and we believe this project can expand quickly and bring gamers, IRL skaters, brands, NFT projects and their communuties if done on a bigger scale.\n\nOnce we have the HQ running we can generate income by: \n\n- Renting space for exposing NFTs and other merch, making them available for purchase\n- Custom events for clients\n- Creating/Selling NFTs with game utility\n- Selling merch(IRL or NFT)\n\nThe funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators.

However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.\n\nUnder the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience. \n\n### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest\nThe team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses. \n\n### Continued development of Decentraland VR\nDecentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.\n\nThe team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"### Decentraland Native Quest Support. \n\nThe team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.\n\n\n### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements. \n\nAs mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR.","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/","roadmap":"### Progress Updates\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum and DAO Discord channel closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

Our COO is Noah Jacobson who is a trained lawyer and operational leader. We've built our mobile app and just launched it this year in the Play and App stores and are gaining traction.  \nSkillProfile lets people create profiles made up of Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and then request anonymous feedback from their friends and colleagues and see the aggregate rating and comments. \nIt's like a 360 review but controlled by the individual and not limited to traditional employment or executives. It democratizes HR and Talent practices and puts it in the hands and control of the people themselves. It can also be extended to non-traditional employment and even game profiles (are you a good teammate, do you tilt under pressure, etc). \n\nWe would like to bring Skillprofile to the metaverse by creating a skills-based game and allows people to own their own profiles and then develop a place where people can share those profiles with others and expand the way we communicate and find employment or other like minded individuals in the metaverse.\n\nOur second phase would include the build out of a job board where users can share their SkillProfiles and potential employers or teammates can identify individuals who might be good candidates to either participate in their games, act as hosts, or do other necessary tasks to maintain the metaverse. Of course as Decentraland develops the way in which people interact could evolve in new and exciting ways so I hesitate to call it traditional employment but more like a place people can learn about themselves, develop their attributes and use them to create a life and experience they want.\nI believe we can create a place where what you bring to the table is verified, owned and is uniquely the individual and where others can find those people.","specification":"SkillProfile the app is already live in the Google Play store and the Apple App store and can be downloaded.

We will also be creating an interactive experience or game to engage new users to claim theirs and start gathering feedback from people they interact with both in game and out.\nWith the grant we would purchase some land in Decentraland to create our scene and will be using Unity to develop an in world game/destination where participants can play, learn about skills.

Every day, MMORPGs bring together millions of people who form strong bonds, communities, and entire economies. Out of a shared passion with cryptocurrencies and MMORPGs, Exodus was born with the goal of making these communities and economies into real, consensus driven assets.\n\nThe name Exodus symbolizes a journey away from the online games we played and cherished as children and towards a new era where crypto assets allow gamers to create real value out of their playtime. We believe that time spent gaming is valuable and want Exodus to realize that belief. Exodus is themed around the concept of moving on from old ways of life and towards a better and more prosperous future. The character will begin in the medieval period and discover new resources, materials, tools, creatures, and questlines. Players will be able to play either passively or actively and work towards special items which will be represented as on-chain assets. The ultimate vision of Exodus is to have a full-fledged blockchain economy capable of providing opportunities to players of all types.\n\nThe JTV team has always focused on educational outreach when onboarding new users. As such, it has grown out of a mutual love for learning and having fun at the same time. The team has volunteered countless hours towards providing Decentraland content and will continue to grow to expand this outreach. JTV embodies this vision and has become a true goodwill of the Decentraland space. With Exodus, the JTV Development team aims to bring thousands of people to Decentraland to have engaging metaverse experiences.","specification":"Team & Experience:\n\nJTV Development is led by none other than JTV, a prominent Decentraland streamer and influencer. JTV streams multiple times a week to onboard new users and share his metaverse experience. Through his promotions and community events, he has distributed tens of thousands of wearables and provided a ‘first wearable’ to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people. JTV has inspired many Decentraland content creators through his goodwill and general want to better himself and his community. In the opinion of the grant writer (not JTV) – JTV deserves the entirety of this grant, though his intention is to support his team and community through the massive task of building Exodus.\n\nThe JTV Engineers include 3 professional software engineers, 1 software intern, and 4 professional designers/artists. This group provides experience in blockchain development, backend engineering, front-end user experience, 3D designs/animations, web-design, and story-writing. If there was a team with the dedication to achieve the vision of Exodus, this is that team. In fact, the team has already volunteered their time towards creating engaging content like the popular JTV Easter egg hunt and scavenger hunts. Despite this grant’s pending status, the team has eagerly begun full-stack development of Exodus.\n\nAs the Exodus project grows, the JTV team intends to provide new metaverse opportunities to design and software interns. We believe that this fits well with the teams focus on educational content and its theme of giving back to the community. This fits well with the mission of Decentraland to empower its players and to provide opportunities to those who seek them.\n\nRevenue sources:\n\nMemberships\n\nAd space \n\nCosmetic NFTs\n\nBackend services","personnel":"Socials:\n\ntwitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nTwitter @JTV____\n\ndiscord.gg/jtv\n\nSite for beta signups.

We intend to add multiple interns (at least 5 interns split between Engineering and Design) to add to this team.\n\nAllocation of Funds:\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering, Design, Marketing, and miscellaneous expenses like music, story writing, and server upkeep. Please understand, these values are approximate and may change depending on need. Engineering and design will include funds purposed towards hiring interns. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts: \n\nEngineering - $125,000 \n\nDesign – $75,000 \n\nMarketing - $25,000 \n\nMiscellaneous - $15,000","roadmap":"The primary release of Exodus will occur over a 6-month period with 3 phases: pre-beta, public-beta, and public release. The pre-beta phase will consist of a gradual release of gathering and crafting activities (woodchopping, fishing, mining, forging, cooking, scavenging), quests, and monster-hunting activities. Once fully rolled out, Exodus will transition into a public-beta purposed towards testing the game and preparing for public launch. Exodus intends to officially launch in January 2023.\n\nWe emphasize, the true roadmap of Exodus extends much further than the 6-month period of this grant. Our team intends to deliver a return of value to Decentraland for the long-term future. After public release, Exodus will continue to focus on attracting new players to Decentraland and building fresh content. Blockchain integration like wearables will be key features of Exodus, and will be continually developed for the game.\n\nWe believe that all grant recipients should strive to return the value of their grant plus some. As such, Exodus intends to contribute 5% of all revenue back to the DAO up to a total value of 300,000 USD. This is a small amount to offer in return for the critical support that the DAO would be providing with this grant and the team intends to deliver this. If successful, not only will this provide a return on the investment that the DAO makes with the grant, but it will also attract thousands of new players to Decentraland who can consume other metaverse content.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11510,"scores_total":397602.7235427992,"votes":88,"manaVP":16329.305264410817,"landVP":196000,"namesVP":17800,"delegatedVP":167473.41827838842,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7"},{"id":"08d6b380-d3c1-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"QmbaqkgBasjqefe6ZA1zsdsycNsyjfgBQnN1MhzoeVZKGg","user":"0xd41308f50858da2b7cc641e493fbddf34775393a","type":"grant","title":"Requesting Tier 3 Grant for purchase of land for NFT project Smvsh Friends","start_at":"2022-05-14T20:04:00.208Z","finish_at":"2022-05-21T20:04:00.206Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Requesting Tier 3 Grant for purchase of land for NFT project Smvsh Friends","abstract":"We are asking for funding to acquire a 1x1 parcel in Decentraland to house our NFT projects lounge and host regular, weekly community events.

The Pacific Cliffs Foundation (PCF) is a community run DAO aimed at winning the bid to lease the Lands End properties.  We are seeking a grant from the Decentraland DAO of $60,000 in order to secure our proposal and set the pieces in motion to make not only our campaign, but the eventual operation a success.\n\nWe have a proposal in place and have lofty plans concocted by local hospitality industry veterans, design professionals, world class construction firms, artists and local families to transform these epic properties into flourishing establishments for locals and tourists.  However, we need to garner the attention of the public in order to generate momentum.  Securing a Decentraland DAO grant will catapult our capabilities  to let us build out or vision and raise a public eyebrow to show that we are serious!\n\nHere's how it works.  The LEP properties will essentially be linked with Decentraland as a major on boarding hub \"in real life\" for Web3 and Decentraland.  Integrating Web3 technology and Decentraland to a tangible space in the real world creates an amazing opprotunity to show what is possible IRL and in the Metaverse.  More specifically, the event space on site will be a Decentraland Metaverse space to bring the Lands End properties and events to everyone around the world, and vice versa.\n\nHost an event on site at the LEP or in Decentraland and it will mirror that event.  For example if I am hosting an educational seminar about how NFTs can revolutionize the publishing industry in the actual event space, it will be broadcast to the corresponding location in Decentraland.","specification":"Upon receipt of the grant $Mana we will begin a course of action to accelerate our campaign.\n\n1.

Showcase the beauty of the property and potential the DAO can have while showcasing the link to Decentraland and how it can be beneficial to the people.\n3. Buy a land in Decentraland. \n4. Establish an office in SF where we can hire engineers, creatives and anyone needed to outline and develop our land to be modeled after the original Cliff House, establish our DAO and outline a plan for what to do once we obtain the lease.\n5. Create an NFT project using local artist and engineers where minting sales and secondary sales all go to the DAO treasury.  NFT project will be hosted and minted through the Land we develop in Decentraland.\n6.

Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. \n\nMAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking. \n\nWe believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.\n\n### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant? \n\nCurrently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.\n\n### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community\n#### Landowners Community\n\n MAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \\MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board. \n\n#### Builders\n\n Decentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there’s a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.\n#### General Community\n\n MAD’s Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space. Building on top of Decentraland, MAD could attract more people into the Decentraland world.","specification":"### Front end framework: Typescript React \n### Product 1: Radical Public Lease\n- Listing from DAO owned land pool and staking land pool [Smart Contract & Front end]\n- Bidding [Smart Contract & Front end]\n  - Harberger Tax employed here. see rules: https://medium.com/metaverse-advertisement-dao/introducing-metaverse-advertisement-dao-the-radical-market-6edb1a8ae7e5\n- Set Builder [Smart Contract]\n  - After a user successfully bids on a land parcel, the landowner can set the builder directly on MAD interface.

One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n- **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n- The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n- **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n- **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n- One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n- The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n- **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n- **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    - Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    - Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\nSure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n- We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL. \nSharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n- Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n- All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n- Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n- Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n- Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n- PvC mode improvements.\n- New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n- We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n- Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.","specification":"Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n\n- **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\nWe plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n\n- **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n\n- **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n\n- **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n\n- **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n\n- **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\nAnd combine these games into one unified economy.\nI am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.","personnel":"-   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago).

Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough.\nOur chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions.\nIn addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it.\nAs our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND!\nThat’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now.\nAll previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.\nSide note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.\nWhile we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.\nAlthough we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap! \n\nWe have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision… Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k).

Each of these have a different attacking style, skills and give different rewards.\n- 5 Spells like Lava Rage to throw a fireball at the opponent or Ice Cold to freeze the opponent.\n- XP and Leveling system to enable long term players to get the maximum earning potential and social clout\n- Beginner and Daily Quests to give the players a smaller goal with rewards \n- A Referral System where anyone can refer a new player to help both of them earn extra coins.\n- POAPs for key achievements in the game.\n- A Clan System where Clan Masters can delegate Clan Membership to other players and earn a passive income. Clan Members get benefits in the form of exclusive team gameplay.\n- An Event everyday, and sometimes more! From daily PvP competitions to weekly extra coin Saturday, double XP Sunday, and an upcoming Magic Themed party.\n\n\n**Growth**: \n\n- Strong and Active Community of 850+ on Discord, 1400+ on Twitter\n- 25,000+ Unique Visitors in just 4 months\n- 2500+ Unique Players have earned a Wilderness NFT [many of them earned their first NFT ever]\n- Active Presence on Twitch  with Neyyyhhaa, co-founder of Wilderness, streaming regularly with an average viewership of 35+\n- $6000+ in secondary market sales creating an estimated market Cap of $40,000+ for Wilderness NFTs .

The Wilderness Treasury will also receive 2.5% of all secondary sales of Wilderness NFTs across all marketplaces [DCL, Opensea, Wilderness Marketplace]\n\nWe have been growing at a growth rate of 8% W-o-W over the last couple of months.

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations. \n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs. \n\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748","specification":"To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build. \n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.","personnel":"This momentous undertaking is a collaborative effort between: \n\n- Reporters without Borders\n- DDB Berlin\n- Metaverse Architects\n- Metaverse Group \n- Tokens.com \n- BlockWorks\n- Media.Monks\n\nEach organization contributes crucial elements to the project.\n\nMore info:\n\nReporters without Borders promote and defend the freedom to be informed and to inform others throughout the world.\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach Berlin (DDB) is a leading advertising firm dedicated to supporting The Uncensored Library’s mission.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses.

But new players typically spawn into the metaverse with little clue about the true potential of this platform. Genesis Plaza provides players with numerous options to get involved in Decentraland, yet many remain confused or simply dormant. There needs to be a better and more consistent way to educate players about what’s possible in Decentraland and get them interacting with each other. \n\nMetaParty wants to take full advantage of Genesis Plaza by hosting welcome events, tours, and informative lessons in the numerous spaces available. Our team is experienced hosting fun and lively events, such as MetaVerse Fashion Week, that draw players of all experience levels into the metaverse. Our grant proposal would allow MetaParty to host regular events in Genesis Plaza that encourage players to explore Decentraland, learn about its features, and have fun interactions with other players.\n\nTo accomplish our goal, MetaParty will hire a series of tour guides in multiple languages to assist new players in Decentraland.

But their art is that good that it absolutely has to be heard. We want to find these artists and make our offer. In addition we also support music and sound design for film, documentary and series. \n\nWith a “charitable social DeFi token” and Artist Project NFT´s it is possible for us to finance our NPO´s Projects and ensure a solid  Mission. \n\nIn addition to regular releases such as physical CD´s and digital Releases as Download and Streaming, we believe in creating NFT´s for each funded Artist Projects and each released Artist on our own Labels we just established. With our Music Publishing Department we are able to sync music to film, documentary and even commercial use. All to get our Artists a good revenue und to finance future projects on the long run.\n\nWe consider ourselves as a modern and open minded Organization useing all available optins to fullfill our Mission & Vision. Therefore it is mandatory that we also have a solid appearance in the metaverse and web 3.0.\n\nIf we get the grant we are going to invest it to purchase a huge piece of land or even an entire own Server to connect it to the Grid.\n\nWe want to use this appearance to explore new Artists for our Funding, network and connecting with our Followers and Supporters we might reach in Decentraland. \n\nThe Funds will also be used to finance the Projects of Artists we discover and find in Decentraland. \n\nWe have founded and taken over 4 Labels. We support all Genres of Music and consider ourselves as an up and coming Indie Major Label & Publisher just with an charitable Background and the Vision to ensure Artistic Freedom.\n\nOur Objectives are not just music support. We work with successful award winning Film Producers with productions on the Big Screen & the respective Streaming Platforms. We want to support Composers for Film & Documentary Music & give them the option to use our studios to record their score as a contribution to film funding.\nWe established an Online & Offline Academy to teach several fields of artistic knowledge such as Self Marketing for Artists, Artist Development, Music Business Administration for Artists but also technical Courses for Audio Engineering, Mastering, Film Making, Media Design. All Tutors offering courses are Industry Professionals, They all contribute some of their time voluntarily.

So we create several Plots that Artists can use for presenting and  selling  Music and  all kinds of other digital Art as NFT´s. It will be a place like a Gallery. \n\nAs we can´t serve all Artists, we will have limited Spots. Artists can apply with examples and our A&R Team will decide about the Artists that are getting a Plot. Every Plot will be given to the Artist for about 3-4 weeks. \n\nAll Artists playing on our Center or Club Stage will automatically be eligible for a Plot to sell their Art and to promote the concerts upfront. Like a typical Concert Merchandise  Shop\n\n\nThe Foundations Virtual Office\n\nWe will create an Office with regular Opening Hours. Here we make sure that anybody can get in touch with us. That means while we are woking in real life we also have an eye on any possible Vistors inside Decentraland.\n\nThe Academy\n\nWith our Online Academy we want to break new ground.  All content is offered for free  & our Live Courses and Masterclasses can be accessed also in Decentraland Talking to the Tutors is possible. \n \nThe Event Stages\n\nWe plan  several stages with plenty of space for visitors, and also going to stream the shows there to the real world on relevant Video Platforms with the goal to get them for the next show into Decentraland.\nIn General; The Performers need to be able to play 100% of the playtime with their own Songs either presented as a Band, Solo Performer, DJ Set or as a Live Act. All Performers need to be present with an Avatar on Stage and are required to Stream the Show from their Home, Bandroom or Studio via Videostream.We also will publish the schedule on our Website.\n \nthe planned Stages are… \n\na Club Stage for electronic music Artists! Not just DJ´s! \n \na Center Stage for Band Music.  \n\na Open Stage. We offer a stage for Artists with an open schedule 24/7/365. Any Artist can book Playtime & promote the Show. The Open Stage is closed during official Events.\n \nOne of our Partners is Microsoft Azure Platform to  video streaming. \n \nThe Foundation Store\n\nWith 4 Labels a Publishing Department and around 24 upcoming funded projects per year we also like to use Decentraland as a place, where interested Visitors can obtain our Label Releases and Project Releases as an NFT. The Difference to a regular sold item in a Download Store is that NFT´s provide Studio Master Files, exclusive NFT-only Content. NFTs will be available 6-8 weeks BEFORE the Public release.\n\nThe Store will be Open to any other Artist with digital Art so we offer a wide range of music and digital Art to Decentraland.\n\nCreative Sandbox for In-World Builders\n\nWe will offer a Sandbox for Decentraland Builders who like to create any sort of Art inside of Decentraland. Same as with the Artist Plots, we offer Plots of different sizes free of charge to Builders. They can create their Project and keep it there for around 4 weeks and place also a Donation Box to get some tips for their creation.The Building Artists decide also on the Donation Split to the Foundation.","personnel":"Our Founders and Team consist of Artists, Audio Engineers, Radio Hosts, Film- and Theatre Actors, DJ´s.

When tokenizing properties, firms with large amounts of assets can easily inspect, control, or liquidate assets much easier. Tokenizing a property also means the ability for people to leverage assets to receive loans and build generational wealth. Whole countries will benefit because they can increase FDI and receive taxes directly from owner wallets. Citizens in countries with bad players in leadership will be protected from corruption and land right grabs because everything can be verified on the blockchain. One of the key components of the project will be the creation of the community governance which ensures it remains decentralized and never in control of the big banks. All that seems ideal but how does this impact or improve decentraland? Well home owners can quickly establish themselves and their property on decentraland using our NFT. The dao and community can use fees to increase DAO funds and the practicality of the ecosytem overall. Larger properties will boost the sale of other digital assets like art and furniture to decorate the digital property. BlockChain Homes in collaboration with decentraland can create a seamless connection between the physical and web 3.0.","specification":"The digitizing process will create thousands of jobs for independent contractors to go to the physical property and use our equipment to digitize the property.

And thank you for taking the time to look over our project. We believe if we receive funding for our project we'd be solving a few issues that new and existing users share. To begin, building affordable housing within decentraland would make it so the community members who don't have a large budget will have a place of their own. In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours. Everyone deserves their own corner of the metaverse and that's what we are trying to achieve for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.","specification":"Once funding is received we would immediately go purchase the ESTATES required for building to begin.

Hence, we moved into SciArtLab where we have scaled into a cineplex with 6 floors including 3 floors with movie screens. SciArtLab has been a major support in marketing our vision to fellow DCL players. Check out the district http://district.sciartlab.com/\n\nWe are also building partnerships with rights owners from the entertainment industry. Some of the people that we have acquired from are\n\n1. Wave Films - http://wave-films.com/\n\n2. IndieRights -https://www.indierights.com/\n\n3. NewGen Entertainment - https://www.newgenentertainment.it/\n\n4.

Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF\n\nAs mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes\n\n1. We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2. We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1. Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live\nhttps://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\n2. Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.\n\n3. Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare.

Now, there’s a tool to help them do it.

In all those explorations, do you know how many people I’ve see outside the plazas (besides at the JP Morgan Chase house)? Three, and they were in one group.\n\nMany of us have properties, billboards, ads, and NFTs that lie dormant in the outside world. What’s the point of having these properties if no one is going to visit them?\nIn Decentraland, there is only one place outside a casino that gets much traffic: Wondermine Meteor Mining. Why does it get traffic? Because people can earn NFTs.\n\nTo get people to engage with our properties, NFTs, ads, billboards, etc., we need to encourage them to engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. To do that, I propose that we provide NFT awards for earning badges for engaging with the larger world.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\nTraveler’s Boots that award a 10% speed increase. These can be earned by exploring 20 miles of Decentraland.\n\nCuriosity Cap – Awarded for opening 150+ UIs to outside websites. Provides 5% discount on Marketplace purchases.\n\nAdventurer’s Sword – Awarded for completing Graveyard Quest, Quest of the Alcoholic Scarecrow, etc. This sword can be used to gain access to a separate questing zone with NPCs to fight and where they can earn money to use to buy more NFTs.\n\nGamer’s Gloves - Awarded to people who achieve high scores at all selected games, including The Adventures of Koko Jones, the Dragon Rush, etc. These can provide a 5% mining bonus for Wondermine.\n\nA list of badges can be found in each user’s dashboard, as well as a checklist for each that shows what they need to do to earn the badge and the associated NFT.\n\nEach badge category can have multiple levels, for instance different boots for exploring 20 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, all with different bonuses.","specification":"The framework for these goals already exist within Decentraland.

It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.\n\nI hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.\n\nWe can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.","specification":"This module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making the creation of courses significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.\n\nThe currently planned features are:\n-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.\n-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)\n-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.\n-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.\n-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game.","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo.

This will be a statue of Mikasa Ackerman (from the Attack on Titan anime TV series). Please read the story down below.\n4. Due to the fact that the statue is related to the Attack on Titan anime series, and I believe, has an impactful and emotional story behind it, it can attract the audience of the Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) TV series, which currently is THE most popular anime in the world with millions of people in its fandom. Also, the timing is just right, because for the time being the long-anticipated season 4 of AoT is finally on air.  \n\n\nTHE SHORT STORY BEHIND THE STATUE\n(spoiler alert)\n\nMikasa Ackerman is sitting next to Eren's grave while wearing the precious red scarf that Eren once gave her. This is the final scene of Attack on Titan manga, Chapter 139, where Eren after his death came in the incarnation of a bird and wrapped the scarf around Mikasa as he promised.\n\n\"I will wrap that scarf around you as many times as you want, now and forever\".\n- Eren to Mikasa.\n\nHOW I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA \n\nThis statue was my first personal project that I never finished till the end. I had an idea of making a 3d printable miniature for sale out of it and I even placed some work-in-progress images of it on my IG back in late May of 2021.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIuFxDD3aF/\n But since June 2021 I was very busy with my freelancing projects so I never had a chance to actually finish the statue and offer it for sale. So in this regard, it's a unique piece of work and was never sold to anyone. \n\nThus, here I am with my model of Statue of Love and I'd like it to be my dent in the universe of Decentraland.","specification":"This work is 90% finished, but I want to take 3 weeks to polish it and give it a more finished look.\n\nYou can check the work-in-progress images with the current look of the statue in my Google Drive that I created especially for you guys\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-xNmYEPM5-RmUSQMF37pOjz6AYnaXpl?usp=sharing\n\n\nIf you're interested to check some of my works, please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar","personnel":"I will be working on this project alone.

While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform.

While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies. \n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access. \n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.","specification":"The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first.

Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam).

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform.

Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.\n\n**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.\n\n**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds.

In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance towards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have been exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical and conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.\n\nThe commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a speculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with them provides.\n\nWe aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added value to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct financing from communities to creators.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers, producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","specification":"BeatBlox Muisc District:\n\nOur primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus of the BeatBlox expansion.

There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services.

WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","description":"When creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.","specification":"Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU","personnel":"**The team**\n\n* **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n* **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n* **Lew Co-founder**, 3D artist\n* **maruudn**, Community manager\n* **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)**, 3D artist","roadmap":"**2022 Q1**\n\n* Server improvements\n* WonderZone NFTs\n* Shared meteors\n* New wearables\n* Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n* In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n* Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n* More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n* Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n* In-game Pets\n* More wearables\n* Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n* Restructuring of the park","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3868,"scores_total":13324438.083519965,"votes":237,"manaVP":9395154.137505237,"landVP":3380000,"namesVP":104900,"delegatedVP":444383.9460147345,"vesting_address":"0xe8a1B5F25b3bF789aFAe04f3F11C0e7d0F527973","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","token":"DAI","vesting_released":240000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":240000},{"id":"7d204d10-5f3f-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"Qma3e7ECfYNPiyxXHVUdtPiQxVxX3AdatBEntDn58AB9JA","user":"0x46d8603959f92b0cff6d453c15c3bbfa945ee890","type":"grant","title":"Copywriter","start_at":"2021-12-17T13:44:00.849Z","finish_at":"2021-12-24T13:44:00.848Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Copywriter","abstract":"Looking for an excellent English/French writer to showcase your startups or product in Metavers?\nOr a quality Trader influencer on Instagram?\n\nHere is your happiness: Mr Passave Christopher , a 19-year-old commercial prep student, delivers his services to you on demand so that your nugget can be known at the four corners of the Metaverse !","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0x46D8603959f92b0Cff6D453c15C3BbFA945Ee890","description":"Hello, my name is Passave Christopher and I offer a quality writing and communication service.

As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2. \n\n\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"Byldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:\n\n1. Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\nByldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2. Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.","personnel":"### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space.

The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land).

This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n \n**WonderZone NFTs** \nMany of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding. \n \n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**\nCurrently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n \n**Kingfisher social fishing game**\nSome of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future.

From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself. Work completed within the METAcademy may be minted as NFTs for collectibles within Decentraland, with duplicates donated to the learning facility collections. Learners may utilize \"rooms\" within the METAcademy to study alone or with peers and participate in discussions. Enter the next generation of education and learn something new today!","specification":"To obtain the name \"METAcademy\" within decentraland, it would cost .007328 ETH. Also, the cheapest parcel of land currently listed for sale is located at -56, -133 for 3,450 ETH.  Alternatively, this design may work with other, more fiscal hosting options. A GoFundMe has also been created to promote donations from intellectuals hoping to secure a location for safe and limitless learning: https://gofund.me/d300c2e2 . This location would act as a host for the different classes offered by teacher users. Learners could assemble and select a class and teacher within the server to be relocated for sessions. Educators may utilize their Avatars to interact with students within Decentraland, list zoom links for online class learning, or use Google systems for materials, links, and videos. Several starter NFTs have already been minted for interaction including the building and emotes: 0xee8f3df7e0a66f2943133eb43dd29b354df060f9\nContracts for educators would include sections which agree to refrain from certain interactions and content. Educators would be independent contractors responsible for the materials, instruction, and feedback for learners.","personnel":"I'm TeacherBr00ke (Brooke Cadieu) and I proposed this learning facility after discovering the new society of online users looking to shape the future. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven. \n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.","roadmap":"Beginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3215,"scores_total":1614235.5621311036,"votes":34,"manaVP":97278.1414551533,"landVP":1170000,"namesVP":23500,"delegatedVP":323457.42067595007,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Community","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x915Aa85DC088ea2d5850d44f9A21c7BF388A9672"},{"id":"8b7dac40-5152-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmV66KKqnv5rmaJPK6uo5Wru3sbx1QTmABdbBMY1ZB9Ze6","user":"0x8238d6d79a2d04999f5872db80812589f6bf689b","type":"grant","title":"Request funds for expanding Decentraland Thailand","start_at":"2021-11-29T20:25:00.108Z","finish_at":"2021-12-06T20:25:00.108Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Request funds for expanding Decentraland Thailand","abstract":"Greeting DCL community,\n\nDCL and MANA just changed my life!

The program will be created using modular design and a heavy focus on implementing interfaces. This means developers will be able grasp the high-level concept of implementation (how all the pieces fit together) and how each function works  (what the individual pieces do). This also provides users a way to add this game to their scenes without needing to have an understanding of programming.\n\nCheckers will be the game that this module will be centred around. Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene. This means a single scene could host several boards at one time, allowing for land owners to create plazas or hubs for users to play at!\n\nWhen completed, the code-base will be publicly hosted on Git so anyone interested can access/download the files. A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want. All rights to the code-base will be waived, pushing it directly into the community's ownership and allowing interested parties to do with it as they please (including hosting on their land/building upon the project/monetizing play).","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo, its a little too small to pull any teammates in. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the projects I've implemented and polished for DCL is Minesweeper, which is currently playable [here!] (https://vercel-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/)","roadmap":"The current estimate for this project is two weeks. During the first week I will implement the functional code and provide a preview of the game scene. By the end of the second week I will have polished the code to maximize readability and optimized the scene to run efficiently. During this time the Git code-base will be made available and the playable preview will be hosted!\n\nThank you for your time,\nTheCryptoTrader69","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":2854,"scores_total":2556974.201124273,"votes":10,"manaVP":2237674.2011242723,"landVP":216000,"namesVP":1300,"delegatedVP":102000,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":"0xf493a2ad834443481c00b1dc8232d7d9f5741c6b6b159124cf5fcb878550f463","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 1","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","token":"MANA","tx_date":"2021-12-16T13:52:39Z","tx_amount":308},{"id":"3511f910-4167-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmUnSy8Pn4LVrJheajHa6Rt3HhNm4Lww9sBWhAXcqoKSc7","user":"0x9b3ae2dd9eaad174cf5700420d4861a5a73a2d2a","type":"grant","title":"Decentraland DAO incubated project - Meta GamiMall (+ P2E game Super Dogerio)","start_at":"2021-11-09T14:13:00.945Z","finish_at":"2021-11-16T14:13:00.945Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Decentraland DAO incubated project - Meta GamiMall (+ P2E game Super Dogerio)","abstract":"The story starts from the success of the Meta City Launch, people enjoy the experience, our displayed NFTs and our gifts, so, why not expand the idea and turn it into a place where people can play, can earn and can shop?

Several prototypes have already been created integrating disparate systems using IPSME.

Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4. \n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services. \n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.","specification":"The specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966  \n\nAnd a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK&index=1\n\nOver the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\n\nThe integration of Minecraft and Doom.  https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/metaverse-doom3-minecraft-integration/\n\nAnd, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/\n\n\n### IPSME:\n- Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards\n- translations are external to the systems being integrated\n- reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead\n- reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear\n- each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure\n- ability to dynamically query the network for new services","personnel":"The aim of this proposal is a 6 to 12 month project.

Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants.

We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue.

We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won’t be just a  ‘tour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.\nI fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I’d love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.","specification":"Hire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.\nHire Website Designer, Videographer\nEducate introductory tour guides\nAny left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!","personnel":"Astrid Pilla, Here's my LinkedIn Profile! https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridpilla/\nAnd my website about page:  https://www.nftcreatortours.com/about\nI’ve conducted docent tours around the Metaverse during DCL 100xArt Week, have volunteered with NFTs.tip s both on the Admin side and as a Clubhouse Room moderator, a writing contributor to NFTS.WTF, helped with several drops and am currently helping about 8 high profile NFT projects as we speak.

I look forward to creating relationships with those I haven’t met already in DCL!","roadmap":"In Phase I,  provide introductory tours and fully onboard 3-4 either creators/brands/celebrities.

After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\n          The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.","specification":"This is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well.

Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1. City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely “wired“ from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2. Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3. User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.  \n\nSummary of work:\n\n* Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox\n* Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature\n* Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed\n\n#### Demo / POC\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74","description":"Full Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md\n\n\n### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items  \n\n\n##### Trigger Types\n\nIncludes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square\n\nI want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n\n##### Text Displaying Types \n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.  \n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.  \n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here \n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n* Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n* Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n* Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","personnel":"I already have one successful approved grant with delivered content.

I want to share it all.\n\nAs of yesterday, I've released an early build of the tools for the community - https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53","description":"You'll be able to easily:\n- Place good looking (and performant) highlight boxes\n- Add holdable/intractable items that will make GAME making so much easier\n- Animate UIImage and UIText with ease. fadeTo, moveTo, scaleTo, ect.\n- Inventory system for displaying details about your holdable items\n- Storage system for placing entities into containers easily\n- Debug tools for placing items in the game, instead of saving and refreshing often\n- Audio/Video sound GUI for your parcel users to adjust volumes for individual audio sources.\n- Experience bars that animate when the value is updated\n- Much much more.\n\nRequests for common problems can be added to the github issue queue for my repo. I'm slowly adding in all of the things I've built. This obviously takes a large amount of time, and I'm doing it for free. Please consider this proposal. What I have already provided should benefit the community already, with some extra mana funds I'll be able to purchase some more land for testing out more interesting experiments which will also be rolled back into the community library I've created.\n\nPlease visit farm (DecentraFarm) to see many of these elements working together (It's still a work in progress obviously)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=0%2C-1&realm=unicorn-blue\n\nAlso visit my comedy/bar venue (TheBlock) - (Also a work in progress)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=-18%2C-122&realm=unicorn-blue","specification":"I'm going to set up a semantic version control for the project very soon.

Tutorial videos will be included for each component, as well as detailed documentation about implementation.","personnel":"Patmacs - I'm very active (maybe even annoyingly so) in the #SDK discord channel. I have over 20 years experience in web development, 18 years professionally. JS/TS, APIs, React, Blender, Photoshop, Solidity, ect. I've done it all probably. Hit me up in discord to test my knowledge/experience on a specific topic.","roadmap":"Over the next few weeks I'll be moving a lot of the code from DecentraFarm into TheBlock in anticipation of a formal grand opening.  This will be done by first adding each feature to the dclconnect npm library,  documenting the process, recording videos, and implementing them into the venue. This process drastically extends the release of my own venue. However, I believe it's worth the effort, if the community can find these tools useful.\n\nThe feature list is included in the Description.\n\nA second phase may include another batch of components/entities that are specifically requested by the community. It may require an additional grant to develop. I'm not quite sure yet.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1297,"scores_total":1459494.7801319598,"votes":38,"manaVP":1029494.7801319604,"landVP":430000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":"0x78b311f4BE9969C41931aDA45d6eC53Bf54998Cf","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53","token":"MANA","vesting_released":7042.25352113,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2021-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":7042.25352113},{"id":"87a5a860-d994-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b","snapshot_id":"QmSYP5zuFyLYz7vjefeUW8S35iuUCSAqnENFFcjh8iKX6e","user":"0x119e6f4644651e77eeb7031f4988ba29346d9608","type":"grant","title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","start_at":"2021-06-30T11:15:00.910Z","finish_at":"2021-07-07T11:15:00.910Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","abstract":"I am going to be hiring a \"Life Coach\" that specializes in assisting people to prepare and finalize their TEDx.

We know that as a  independent designer with conviction we want to spread our vision across every known universe even the parallel. In addition to the wearables and art we will bring the music that is a major cultural part of the brand dna. Having already worked on real world events with artists like Seth Troxler, Martinez Brothers, A$AP Rocky, and some of the best DJs from Berlin to London to Hong Kong and Brazil we see an after party as the best way to bring the vision into the full audio visual experience by recruiting a nice lineup of artists to share a great event with the Decentraland community to celebrate with ALIVE AND MORE","specification":"The wearables will be by the designer and artist behind ALIVE AND MORE Karl Phenom ( http://instagram.com/karlphenom \nHaving the first hand experience in the construction and design of the original real world pieces will make executing the Decentraland wearables with as much authenticity possible a key in the results of the works.\n\nFor the After party event we plan to stream live video of Djs performing from around the world at their respective studios using OBS Studio and RTMP-Server.com as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBDf-dR7DU\n\nWhile the aim will be to live stream the dj sets we may or may not accept pre-recorded video of the performances and then stream them live at the event for the first time to the community","personnel":"Karl \"Phenom\" Jouanni based in Ibiza, Spain aka the Illustrious one the Art Creative Director, Designer and Founder of ALIVE AND MORE and TEAM RELMS ( https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/fashion/alive-and-more/ )  will head the majority of the wearable designs using Photoshop, Blender, Unity and Maya.

We will invite the community to enjoy the live music and show off their wearables and how they chose to combine them with their looks and avatars if they did get a chance to grab one.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.  \n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in. \n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.    \n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.","specification":"This project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.  The approach will be to utilise what is already available before building anything new.  \n\nThe University District and its already established structures such as Decentraland University and Learning Spheres, will make for a suitable location to run this event, though some additional development is foreseen as necessary. \n\nA small research study will be performed to identify the feasibility of all existing reusable resources for this event.  The outcome of the research study will report a detailed plan of implementation using agile and iterative development methodologies.  \n\nNecessary modifications and additions to scenes/features will be developed through the Decentraland SDK and 3D modelling software (such as Blender).  This project will contribute to the open-source code repositories.    \n\nAlready identified existing [GitHub](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes) resources include:\n- Wearables-store\n- Crypto-valley-art-gallery\n- Clap-meter\n- POAP-Booth\n- Nft-scanner\n- Ws-broadcast\n- Switchboard-platforms\n- Grab-objects\n- Guest-Book-API\n- Beer-dispenser\n- Donations-Box\n- Paid-Button\n- Paid-Lever\n- Sliding-door\n- Npc-dialog-example-scene\n- Events-API\n- Digital-bouncer\n- Basic-Interactions\n- Grab-objects-advanced\n- discordWebsocket\n- Nft-wall-example-scene\n\nExperience has been gained in using the SDK and deploying dcl scenes to local development environments.","personnel":"This project will be managed by [Troy Sadkowsky](https://www.google.com/search?q=troy+sadkowsky), CTO and Data Scientist at [Data Logical Services Pty Ltd](https://datalogicalservices.com/).

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control \nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) \nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.  \n\n##### Scene Add/remove\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here \n\n[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.","personnel":"### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here [https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.  \nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27  \n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.  You can find my submission here:\nhttps://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/a1890011-77d7-415c-aeb2-452e3a186391?realm=localhost-stub.  Again I used the Builder and but this time also the SDK to enhance the Voxter smart item given to the contestants improving its experience and features in the Builder.  Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2","roadmap":"### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1194,"scores_total":1198561.1450458097,"votes":36,"manaVP":876561.1450458096,"landVP":322000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":"0x14790738ee100309cd7038d17b289292b2109af7c0d18aa40d9095f9827d3264","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 2","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74","token":"MANA","tx_date":"2021-07-14T20:40:09Z","tx_amount":5000},{"id":"d0a802a0-d378-11eb-987d-410735a966ad","snapshot_id":"QmcEtXsQLg9nY3ACAPFivBrHMTZo1KpKF1niFsJYrF5Br6","user":"0x6411a6771684e0b8535b57e64fb81d1a7facea07","type":"grant","title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","start_at":"2021-06-22T16:42:00.514Z","finish_at":"2021-06-29T16:42:00.514Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","abstract":"I want to start a youtube channel, of motor biking, showing the beauty of North-east India.
