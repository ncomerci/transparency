Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. \n\nMAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking. \n\nWe believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.\n\n### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant? \n\nCurrently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.\n\n### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community\n#### Landowners Community\n\n MAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \\MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board. \n\n#### Builders\n\n Decentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there‚Äôs a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.\n#### General Community\n\n MAD‚Äôs Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space.

Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera. \n\nDecentraland has been using¬†**[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the¬†**[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)**¬†of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.\n\nThe way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**","specification":"Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it‚Äôs important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland‚Äôs growth. \n\nIt‚Äôs important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp. \n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.","conclusion":"If this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11214,"scores_total":2006963,"votes":28,"manaVP":304414,"landVP":230000,"namesVP":7100,"delegatedVP":1465448,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"ebb6db70-cadf-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1","snapshot_id":"QmbTcM5sYbNdtqV9yzNn22R1WnC9DcuoFXxB2NnSAawfE7","user":"0xfc5c2d3aecb8db6e8b871ad2d6786cfcabe84a00","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 130,-13 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-05-03T12:52:00.279Z","finish_at":"2022-05-10T12:52:00.278Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"active","configuration":{"x":130,"y":-13,"type":"add_poi","description":"The scene located at 130, -13 is the Damex Metaoffice.

This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.","specification":"**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1. **By the DAO Committee:**\n- Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n- After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n- Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n- DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2. **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n- The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\nAfter 24 hours, the member is removed\n- 3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n- In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n- Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member‚Äôs powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n- If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3. **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n- The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    - The name of the committee member to remove\n    - Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n- To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP. \n- The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\nIn the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n1. If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2. If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n- In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n- The Committee member‚Äôs COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO‚Äôs behalf.\n- The Committee member‚Äôs address must be removed from the DAO‚Äôs multisig proxy.\n- The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications","impacts":"This proposal will enable multiple pathways for DAO Committee Members to be removed, resign, and be elected to the committee. It also creates legitimate pathways for rapid response by the Security Advisory Board (SAB) and other DAO Committee members in an emergency situation.Up to this time, there has been no formal pathway for the removal or appointment of new committee members.","implementation_pathways":"At this time, there is one DAO Committee spot open. Following approval of this proposal, the DAO committee will release an open call for DAO Committee Member Applicants, and follow the process outlined in the conclusion section below. Additionally, the DAO Committee will coordinate with the SAB to modify necessary Parameters via the DAO's Aragon infrastructure.","conclusion":"**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n1. What is your full name?\n2. What is your primary wallet address?\n3. Why are you applying?\n4. What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland‚Äôs DAO?\n5. What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6. Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7. Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8. Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.   \n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO‚Äôs trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process. \n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11205,"scores_total":339421,"votes":14,"manaVP":1951,"landVP":158000,"namesVP":12300,"delegatedVP":167170,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"d22828a0-ca7e-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1","snapshot_id":"QmcK4CdWjTw1HXq6wQCGv8NoCmkwufq3JJkEyT3HMCwhgM","user":"0xae8bf49b1f8d56061bc693b7841c785b8e903ec5","type":"poll","title":"Adding VP for Wearable Creations DCL","start_at":"2022-05-03T01:17:00.218Z","finish_at":"2022-05-08T01:17:00.218Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Adding VP for Wearable Creations DCL","description":"\"This was idea was featured in an earlier poll of mine, and it caught a lot of traction.

As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people. For example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse? For those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system for giving creators of wearables VP\n\nCreation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission.

One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n- **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n- The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n- **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n- **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n- One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n- The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n- **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n- **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    - Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    - Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\nSure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it‚Äôs huge for daily players. We‚Äôve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n- We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL. \nSharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n- Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n- All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n- Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n- Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n- Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n- PvC mode improvements.\n- New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n- We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n- Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.","specification":"Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n\n- **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\nWe plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n\n- **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n\n- **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n\n- **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n\n- **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n\n- **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\nAnd combine these games into one unified economy.\nI am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.","personnel":"-   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago).

For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.\nSide note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.\nWhile we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.\nAlthough we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap! \n\nWe have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision‚Ä¶ Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k).

Each of these have a different attacking style, skills and give different rewards.\n- 5 Spells like Lava Rage to throw a fireball at the opponent or Ice Cold to freeze the opponent.\n- XP and Leveling system to enable long term players to get the maximum earning potential and social clout\n- Beginner and Daily Quests to give the players a smaller goal with rewards \n- A Referral System where anyone can refer a new player to help both of them earn extra coins.\n- POAPs for key achievements in the game.\n- A Clan System where Clan Masters can delegate Clan Membership to other players and earn a passive income.

These cargo crates contain a randomized assortment of resources/materials. These cargo containers can only be opened in the Junkyard. While also in the Junkyard, players can rummage through the scrap piles to gather additional resources/materials. Players will take these materials and resources to the crafting station where they can craft vehicle tokens to redeem at the shop.

Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:\n\n- Decentraland Foundation-maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).\n- DAO-maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.\n\n### Problem\n\nThis **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership of the project** since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.\n\n\n### Potential Solutions\nThere are a couple of solutions we could implement if we want to unify both lists:\n\n- We could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**\n\n- We could also delete the Legacy POI List and let the community re-add the POIs that are still relevant (Genesis Plaza for example!) to the DAO-maintained list. To minimize the risk of losing an important POI, before the deletion of the Legacy list we could have a discussion on Discord and the Forum about the relevant POIs that we absolutely need to migrate so we can start creating proposals right after the Legacy list has been deleted.\n\n[Legacy POI List](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) -  See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names\n\nThis pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.","choices":["Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list","Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs","No, maintain both lists","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":11010,"scores_total":3146938,"votes":16,"manaVP":49289,"landVP":1680000,"namesVP":11900,"delegatedVP":1405749,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"f26d0d80-c400-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4","snapshot_id":"QmZyogsN7fRtt4VAYK5ZUrsop7j2e9oBperMZpkiJiiqQ2","user":"0x29519122d08771ca4c83c8e3fa981df18721f76d","type":"poi","title":"Remove the location 144,-14 from the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-04-24T19:01:00.792Z","finish_at":"2022-05-01T19:01:00.787Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"x":144,"y":-14,"type":"remove_poi","description":"This is our old DCL Real Estate office.

Free transactions mean that Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction they perform (in Polygon) while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera. \n\nDecentraland has been using¬†**[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the¬†**[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)**¬†of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021. Biconomy works by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.** \n\n# Solution\n\nUp until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it‚Äôs important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland‚Äôs growth. \n\nIt‚Äôs important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp. \n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and keep the flywheel spinning: better UX > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nIf this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\", it will be promoted to a Draft proposing the DAO Committee to be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.","choices":["Yes: Authorize the DAO Committee to continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank","No: Do not continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":10922,"scores_total":957429,"votes":80,"manaVP":56871,"landVP":448000,"namesVP":9500,"delegatedVP":443058,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"908896f0-c222-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4","snapshot_id":"QmQ3pX8vmz6TZ6XGyKM1FFgTnN1UzrGo9CVuxiXo5FXhPy","user":"0x73b8bfa9b609077999e41a4e6a3e233dbf70faa0","type":"linked_wearables","title":"Add NTR1-META to the Linked Wearables Registry","start_at":"2022-04-22T09:57:00.119Z","finish_at":"2022-04-29T09:57:00.118Z","required_to_pass":4000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"NTR1-META","links":["https://ntr1-meta.com/","https://swappable.io/","https://discord.com/invite/uZ4CePdaqY"],"nft_collections":"We have created a collection of 5,000 NFT wearable sneakers across 40 different designs and rarity tiers, created in collaboration with 25 of the hottest web3 projects, including exclusive sneaker wearables created in partnership with Decentraland, Polygon and The Sneakerheadz Society.\n\nThese NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers, which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.","items":5000,"smart_contract":["0xF20B2647679D32FF36dCD17Fe4FfA5661EF79E7b"],"governance":"This is a collaborative project between Another-1 and Swappable by TrustSwap.\n\nYou can find out more about Another-1 and their team with the following links:\n- https://another-1.io\n- https://twitter.com/AN1official\n\nYou can find out more about Swappable and TrustSwap with the following links:\n- https://swappable.io\n- https://twitter.com/Swappable_NFTs\n- https://trustswap.com\n- https://twitter.com/TrustSwap","motivation":"We are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!\n\nWe're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!\n\nWe moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ.

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library‚Äô in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project‚Äôs maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of ‚Ç¨0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland‚Äôs Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations. \n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‚Äòdigital home of press freedom‚Äô to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs. \n\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748","specification":"To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build. \n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.","personnel":"This momentous undertaking is a collaborative effort between: \n\n- Reporters without Borders\n- DDB Berlin\n- Metaverse Architects\n- Metaverse Group \n- Tokens.com \n- BlockWorks\n- Media.Monks\n\nEach organization contributes crucial elements to the project.\n\nMore info:\n\nReporters without Borders promote and defend the freedom to be informed and to inform others throughout the world.\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach Berlin (DDB) is a leading advertising firm dedicated to supporting The Uncensored Library‚Äôs mission.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses.

Thanks to the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees, this operation doesn‚Äôt have a monetary loss for the committee members. However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and **those efforts are not being compensated in any form**. I believe this is a problem for the long-term sustainable operation of the DAO.\n\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement that can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**I believe we need to start compensating the DAO Committee members and set the grounds for a sustainable DAO Committee.

But new players typically spawn into the metaverse with little clue about the true potential of this platform. Genesis Plaza provides players with numerous options to get involved in Decentraland, yet many remain confused or simply dormant. There needs to be a better and more consistent way to educate players about what‚Äôs possible in Decentraland and get them interacting with each other. \n\nMetaParty wants to take full advantage of Genesis Plaza by hosting welcome events, tours, and informative lessons in the numerous spaces available. Our team is experienced hosting fun and lively events, such as MetaVerse Fashion Week, that draw players of all experience levels into the metaverse. Our grant proposal would allow MetaParty to host regular events in Genesis Plaza that encourage players to explore Decentraland, learn about its features, and have fun interactions with other players.\n\nTo accomplish our goal, MetaParty will hire a series of tour guides in multiple languages to assist new players in Decentraland. This process will include accountability measures in which the community can track our progress via a sign-in sheet. MetaParty will train, oversee, and manage these tour guides to ensure quality experiences for new players. \n\nWe‚Äôve created a YouTube video describing the proposal that shows a demo tour, which can be viewed at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyY8XqKaDg","specification":"We‚Äôre proposing the following:\n\nMetaParty staff members are present at Genesis Plaza five days a week Monday through Friday during 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC to give tours, host fun events, and teach new users about Decentraland. Our staff will use a combination of voice and text features to alert new users to join the tour.\n\nThe tour will take place once per hour from 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC and last about 20 minutes, taking new players through the main buildings in Genesis Plaza (outlined below) and use each location to speak about different aspects of Decentraland: NFTs, wearables, land, wearable design and more. \n\nLessons will take place once per shift at 2pm UTC at different venues throughout Genesis Plaza and cover the following: Introduction to Builder, Introduction to Wearable Creation and Introduction to Social Media, Branding and Marketing for Decentraland.\n\nTour outline:\n\nNote: While some buildings in Genesis Plaza are explicitly named, others are unnamed. For the purposes of our tour, we‚Äôve named buildings that lack a name. For a visual representation of each tour stop, please see our video proposal linked above.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize the importance of having tours conducted in multiple languages to reach the worldwide audience coming into Decentraland. Proceeds from the grant will go towards hiring Spanish language tour guides and additional language speakers.\n\nMain Building (0,0) - Quick overview of Decentraland basics; how to run, walk, emote, access backpack and view the main map.

In addition we will briefly cover smart wearables.\n\nTrade Center (6,-7) - Discuss MANA as an asset that can be bought and traded. At this point in the tour we will briefly cover how to set up a MetaMask wallet, and provide links in game to Decentraland content creators videos that go into further detail about MetaMask.\n\nNFT Hallway (-1,-4) - Introduction to NFTs and discussion on the different forms they take in Decentraland. \n\nSocial Building (-2,-9) - Talk about Decentraland social media channels like Twitter and Discord. Briefly discuss the Builder and how it can be used via a link in this area. Furthermore, we will cover Decentraland content creators.\n\nRose Building (-7,7) - The final tour stop will be used to discuss communities in Decentraland that host events and other fun interactive experiences. We will introduce players to the Decentraland Events page. Tour ends with a question and answer portion.\n\nMega-Party - At the end of each month, new users will be invited to a Mega-Party hosted by MetaParty in Genesis Plaza at the auditorium. This party will take place on the last friday of each month at 8pm UTC. It will feature performances from DJs like DJTrax and other performers associated with MetaParty. Special guests from the community will be invited for talks. \n\nLesson Outline:\n\nPlease refer to the PDF document linked below for a full lesson outline.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/377TfJ6","personnel":"Rezinator\nFounder, Head of Business Development and Community Management\n\nRezinator leads community management, project development and event hosting/planning for MetaParty.

This eliminates a reasonable resale market.\n\n*The small group that already appears to be pricing for fractional mana are mostly item farming accounts/bots.\n\n*By opening up the secondary market to lower valued items, it will increase the interest and accessibility to the market.  New users could save for higher valued or more desirable items without having to spend fiat to participate.  Many people cannot afford to purchase MANA, but almost everyone has items they have been given through events or content creator giveaways.\n\n*This could potentially SAVE the DAO in matic gas fees by reducing the number of junk listings which never sell, and get relisted by the thousands on a daily basis.

Not just DJ¬¥s! \n \na Center Stage for Band Music.  \n\na Open Stage. We offer a stage for Artists with an open schedule 24/7/365. Any Artist can book Playtime & promote the Show. The Open Stage is closed during official Events.\n \nOne of our Partners is Microsoft Azure Platform to  video streaming. \n \nThe Foundation Store\n\nWith 4 Labels a Publishing Department and around 24 upcoming funded projects per year we also like to use Decentraland as a place, where interested Visitors can obtain our Label Releases and Project Releases as an NFT. The Difference to a regular sold item in a Download Store is that NFT¬¥s provide Studio Master Files, exclusive NFT-only Content. NFTs will be available 6-8 weeks BEFORE the Public release.\n\nThe Store will be Open to any other Artist with digital Art so we offer a wide range of music and digital Art to Decentraland.\n\nCreative Sandbox for In-World Builders\n\nWe will offer a Sandbox for Decentraland Builders who like to create any sort of Art inside of Decentraland. Same as with the Artist Plots, we offer Plots of different sizes free of charge to Builders. They can create their Project and keep it there for around 4 weeks and place also a Donation Box to get some tips for their creation.The Building Artists decide also on the Donation Split to the Foundation.","personnel":"Our Founders and Team consist of Artists, Audio Engineers, Radio Hosts, Film- and Theatre Actors, DJ¬¥s.

In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when navigating through Decentraland.\n\nThe goal of this project is to **onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.","specification":"**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland**¬†that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not¬†**[regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/)**. They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. **They can not be bought or sold in Decentraland‚Äôs Marketplace.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1. **Create a DAO proposal**¬†in the category¬†**‚ÄúLinked Wearables Registry‚Äù**¬†to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.\n2. Wait one week for DAO's approval and pass the 4M VP threshold.\n3. **Submit wearables**¬†in the¬†**Builder**¬†using the available¬†Slots.\n4. Develop the API following [this specification](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n5. Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n6. Spread the word! Tell your community that they can¬†**enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**Application Process**\n\nThird parties will create a DAO proposal in the category ‚ÄúLinked Wearables Registry‚Äù to be accepted in the registry. The vote will last for a week and will require a minimum threshold of participation of 4M VP.\n\nThe inclusion of the third party into the Registry will be done by the DAO Committee. This process will create slots for the third party and enable access to the publication flow.\n\n**Slots**\n\nA Slot is a potential representation of an NFT as a Decentraland Wearable. They define the maximum amount of different wearables designs the Third Party can use.\n\nDepending on the strategy the collection owners choose, they can request 1 slot (i.e. All holders of the NFT collection will get the same Linked Wearable) or multiple slots (i.e. If the collection has 7,777 NFTs they can request for 7,777 slots to match the wearable with the NFTs look & feel)\n\nSlots are free and requested by third parties on their application. They can later request more slots if necessary.\n\n**Wearable Submission**\n\nThe Third Party will be able to use the Builder tool to submit a wearable design for each Slot. The wearable model must follow the same specs as any regular wearables and will be subject to the curation process of the Wearable Curation Committee.\n\n**API Development**\n\nOnce the wearables are submitted to review the third party must create an API that resolves the assignment between NFT owners and Decentraland Wearables.\n\nThis is a scalable and cross-chain solution to accommodate different scenarios. The API might assign the same wearable for every NFT holder; or different wearables for different groups of NFT holders; or even more, a unique design for each NFT holder.\n\n**Curation Process**\n\nThe Wearable Curation Committee will curate the submitted wearables as part of their regular flow. The curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn‚Äôt matter what type of collection it is.\n\nFor Programmatic Collections with more the 50 items, the curation won‚Äôt review each design one by one, instead, a new curation process will be executed following these general guidelines:\n\n1. Audit the wearable generation process.\n2. Define a curation plan based on the process.\n3. Curate 1% of the collection (min 50, max 300).","impacts":"Linked Wearables will enable NFT Communities to customize their avatar in Decentraland. This is beneficial for both parties because the **NFTs get a new use case** (adding value to the collection and the community) and also, new users will be exposed to Decentraland‚Äôs experience.\n\nThis proposal will create a new flow of publication of wearables that might compete with the current publication process. This issue is mitigated by several factors:\n\n1. **Third Parties need to be approved by the DAO** in order to use this publication flow.\n2. The NFTs associated with **these wearables can‚Äôt be traded in Decentraland‚Äôs marketplace.**\n3. Third-party need their own NFT smart contract and build/maintain a public API for the integration to work.\n\nThe DAO will not receive submission fees for this process but still cover the compensation of the Wearable Curator Committee, thus increase DAO‚Äôs expenses. However, with the current situation of the DAO treasury this shouldn‚Äôt be a limitation, and instead see it as a marketing investment.\n\nThe Linked Wearables project will also incentivize the wearable creation economy, generating more jobs for 3d designers and studios with experience in Decentraland. The NFT communities won‚Äôt pay the DAO a submission fee but will invest resources in those with knowledge in the craft of wearable making.\n\nExpected upsides:\n\n- Onboard many NFT communities to Decentraland.\n- Become a case study about interoperability between NFT projects.\n\nUndesirable (but possible) outcomes:\n\n- Communities might not gather enough VP to be listed in the Linked Wearables Registry.\n- Implementation and maintenance of integration might be costly for members of the Linked Wearables Registry.","implementation_pathways":"The implementation of this feature involves the following applications:\n\n- Governance dApp.\n    - Enable the external NFT communities to propose themselves for the registry.\n- Linked Wearables Registry - A new dApp to manage the registry.\n    - DAO Committee Members can add new members to the registry.\n    - DAO Committee Members can manage available slots for registry members.\n    - Registry members can update their managers and resolver API.\n\n- Builder Tool\n    - Managers of the communities listed on the Linked Wearable Registry will be able to create collections using their available slots and submit them to review.\n    - Wearable Curation Committee will review the collections and upload the content to the catalysts network upon approval.\n\n- Third-party API\n    - This is an external API maintained by the third parties in Linked Wearables Registry.\n    - It enables the mapping between NFT owners and submitted wearables.\n\n- World Explorer:\n    - Wearables linked to external NFTs will be displayed in the explorer's backpack.","conclusion":"This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer.

It will do so by increasing the collateralized MANA in Maker protocol and increasing the liquidity volumes in decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n**Background**\n\n [MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/) , one of the oldest DAOs, provides a significant service to the crypto and decentralized finance space: it‚Äôs the DAO behind the stablecoin known as DAI. DAI‚Äôs value is backed by different crypto assets such as ETH, USDC, USDT, etc. The MakerDAO community defines DAI as a ‚Äúdecentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar.‚Äù DAI‚Äôs collateral backing, then, is part of the stablecoin‚Äôs essence.\n\nIn July 2020,  [MakerDAO included MANA](https://blog.makerdao.com/mana-approved-by-maker-governance-as-collateral-type-in-the-maker-protocol/)  as acceptable collateral for minting new DAI in the platform. This authorization represented excellent news for MANA, since it meant an upgrade in its status as a reserve of value. Users could now take out a DAI loan using their MANA as collateral without the need to sell it first.\n\nYet, in late 2021, MANA almost got downgraded again in a sudden turn of events. The attempt began with a signal request, a formal proposition for action or change in a specific platform. Signal requests are usually coupled with polls through which the community votes whether accept or decline the proposals. In September 2021,  [a signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-mana-bat-zrx-lrc-univ2-linketh-and-univ2-aaveeth/10467)  from the MakerDAO forum presented a plan to remove MANA and some other tokens as acceptable collateral. By the time the polls closed in early October, the initiative had gathered enough votes to offboard and delist many tokens. But MANA, for its part, was spared from the offboarding. Thanks to community signaling, which advised against a downgrade, MANA persisted in the list of acceptable collateral for minting new DAI.\n\nAs observed per the cited signal request, the MakerDAO is interested in delisting unprofitable collateral types. The MakerDAO has sufficient incentive to remove the less efficient collateral types. First off, every collateral type has some fixed costs on oracle price feeds. On the other hand, each collateral type brings extra complexity to the team maintaining the project.\n\nIn this vein, MakerDAO is interested in seeing more DAI minted with MANA as collateral; otherwise, MANA might be delisted and no longer stand as acceptable collateral. Also, MakerDAO would like to see more liquidity in exchanges between MANA and DAI. They expect such increased liquidity because, if the price of MANA were to drop abruptly, a more liquid scenario would help reduce the risk of liquidating an undercollateralized position of MANA. \n\n**Description**\n\nThe current fee to mint DAI using MANA as collateral is 6% annually.\n\nAfter conversations with MakerDAO, they might consider reducing this fee to 3% if we (1) reach 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA while (2) increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\nThere are methodic steps in reaching both goals. Thus, this proposal describes the use of the DAOs Treasury holdings to increase the MANA collateral and liquidity in exchanges ‚Äî therefore matching the two standards that MakerDAO expects.\n\nAs a side note, it‚Äôs important to mention that if this initiative succeeds, it will result in a very positive outcome for the MANA holding community. In what would be a significant step ahead, a MANA holder looking to request a loan using her MANA as collateral will find her annual rates cut by half.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe straightforward way to tackle the dual challenge would be contributing towards liquidity. So, for the sake of examples, let‚Äôs say the DAO wants to contribute 5M in collateralized MANA for this cause.\n\nTo contribute such a sum, The DAO would need to take some MANA from its treasury and lock it in a Maker Volt. In exchange for it, the DAO would receive 5M of DAI. This is, quite plainly, a loan collateralized with MANA.\n\nSuch a loan should be over-collateralized to ensure we don‚Äôt lose the collateral in the sudden event of a MANA price drop. Therefore, the suggestion is to do a 3x collateralized ratio. At the current MANA price, that would signify ~6,200,000 MANA, which would, in turn, represent 5M of DAI.\n\nAt the moment, we should pay an annual interest rate of 6%. Thus, keeping up with the former logic, it would represent 180,000 DAI. But that‚Äôs the worst-case scenario. Since the whole initiative intends to succeed, MakerDAO will eventually reduce this fee to 3%, thus downsizing the sum to half.\n\nAfterward, we should position 5M of DAI + 5M worth of MANA in the MANA<>DAI Liquidity Pool at Sushiswap. Why Sushiswap? It‚Äôs simple: it has the deepest liquidity for the pair in any DEX. According to this  [MANA/DAI liquidity poll](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x495f8ef80e13e9e1e77d60d2f384bb49694823ef)  (LP), we can expect a return of investment of 2,000 DAI per day. It would not only cover the costs of the loan ‚Äî but it would also leave a significant margin in net DAO profits.\n\nThe previous example, then, would prove successful in achieving the double goal of accruing 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA, all while increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith a set of strategic steps, Decentraland‚Äôs DAO can significantly contribute to securing MANA‚Äôs position in the DAI ecosystem, maintaining MANA as acceptable collateral, reducing the loan fees for MANA holders, and improving the liquidity of DEXs.\n\nThere is a tested strategy to address this issue, and the DAO suggests we take on it.\n\nVote\n* For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO\n* Against: Do nothing","choices":["For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO","Against: Do nothing","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":10087,"scores_total":946373,"votes":20,"manaVP":157856,"landVP":214000,"namesVP":2500,"delegatedVP":572017,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmchxF8CU2ehk9svKfZUSUCpzqwEsFG6ZDEanQhmdiaEaL","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"draft","title":"Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members","start_at":"2022-03-28T08:45:00.362Z","finish_at":"2022-04-04T08:45:00.360Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"782bbe80-9adf-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","title":"Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members","summary":"The DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.","abstract":"The DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:\n\n- When a committee member resigns\n- When the community wants to replace a committee member\n- When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency\n\nThere are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:\n\n- Decisions must be as decentralized as possible\n-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee\n- Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together\n-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency\n\nBearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.","motivation":"**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.","specification":"**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1. **By the DAO Committee:**\n- Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n- After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n- Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n- DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2. **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n- The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\nAfter 24 hours, the member is removed\n- 3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n- In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n- Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member‚Äôs powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n- If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3. **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n- The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    - The name of the committee member to remove\n    - Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n- To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP. \n- The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\nIn the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n1. If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2. If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n- In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n- The Committee member‚Äôs COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO‚Äôs behalf.\n- The Committee member‚Äôs address must be removed from the DAO‚Äôs multisig proxy.\n- The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications","conclusion":"**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n1. What is your full name?\n2. What is your primary wallet address?\n3. Why are you applying?\n4. What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland‚Äôs DAO?\n5. What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6. Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7. Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8. Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.   \n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO‚Äôs trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process. \n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":10080,"scores_total":2078227,"votes":25,"manaVP":1142991,"landVP":168000,"namesVP":5400,"delegatedVP":761836,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"2d2a9f40-adfa-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmVZwLszSs9Cuc223Nr5n7MJwXbZhME1kbAHJzX2fPQfCS","user":"0xe7e477ef1676a46ae6621983834a6e0b29c06979","type":"grant","title":"Affordable Housing (Apartments and Townhomes)","start_at":"2022-03-27T18:17:00.284Z","finish_at":"2022-04-10T18:17:00.282Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Affordable Housing (Apartments and Townhomes)","abstract":"We are a small group of technical artists and coders who have recently fallen in love with the decentraland metaverse.

And thank you for taking the time to look over our project. We believe if we receive funding for our project we'd be solving a few issues that new and existing users share. To begin, building affordable housing within decentraland would make it so the community members who don't have a large budget will have a place of their own. In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours.

The [original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) (this one), where this feature was introduced and first described. It was called Third Party Wearables at that moment. Here is a short phrase that captures its intent:\n    \n    *In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.*\n    \n    The process to make Linked Wearables was simple, but there were some things that where not detailed. That‚Äôs where the second proposal comes in. \n    \n2. [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) for Linked Wearables: As you may have read from the original proposal, third parties needed to buy Slots for each 3D representation of their NFTs. But at which price? The result of that proposal was to make it pair with the current submission fee for regular wearables. This makes sense, but if you dig deeper, some differences come evident. For example, Linked Wearables can not be sold in the marketplace, they don‚Äôt have rarities and are not exactly wearables. So it may be worth to be thought again and find a better balance. \n3. [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) came third to cover a particular use case that was brought up by interested third parties. The fact is that many communities interested in this have really large collections that were made programmatically. This means a software combined a set of pre-designed traits to get the final models as a result. With the fee defined in the prior proposal, it got totally restrictive for these communities as it would cost millions to have Linked Wearables, getting all of us far from the spirit of the feature, which should be inclusive by definition. \n\nA lot has been learned from past proposals. Now, I‚Äôd like to propose an improvement that would help this feature to meet its true goal: **Onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.","specification":"**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not [regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/). They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. \n\nLinked Wearables do not exist inside traditional wearable collections, have no rarity, and **can not** be sold in [primary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item&section=wearables) or [secondary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=nft&section=wearables&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=recently_listed&onlyOnSale=true&viewAsGuest=false&onlySmart=false) markets. They are only **in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the Third Party.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1. **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **‚ÄúLinked Wearables Registry‚Äù** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available. \n2. Wait one week for DAO's approval. Ask your community for help, they can vote for you to be accepted. \n3. **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available **Slots**. Once the item is submitted to the builder you will see a property called **URN**. That **URN** is the one that you will need to use in the [API response](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n4. Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n5. Develop the API.\n6. Spread the word! tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**So what is missing though?**\n\nThere are 3 very important things that were not addressed in the previous lines or need to be reviewed:\n\n1. What would be the **VP (voting power)** threshold needed for Third Parties to be approved (not discussed yet)\n2. What would be the final **price of each slot** \n3. How many items will **curators review** in programmatic and hand-made collections\n\nEven though the price of slots were set at a fixed rate of 500 USD and the approach to curate programmatic collections was declined (details mentioned above), I propose the following combination to support third parties and, at the same time, being cautious of which third party is actually approved:\n\n1. **4M VP threshold**\n\nThis would be a blocker for scammers and people with bad intentions that don‚Äôt have a strong community and only want to abuse this feature by flooding the catalyst network with 3D Models. At the same time, only legit communities would pass this filter. \n\n2. **Free slots**\n\nThe DAO will be the only beneficiary from a fee here, but as the goal is to encourage communities to come into Decentraland, the DAO could afford this and give Slots to Third Parties when they need them. \n\n3. **\"Reasonable\" curation**\n\nHand-made collections have to be curated in full as there is no guarantee on how each 3D model was made, but for programmatic collections, the perfect balance would be to:\n\n1. Audit the process \n\n2. Curate 1% of the collection \n\n3. Minimum of 50 items to be curated (if the programmatic collection has less than 50 items, it has to be curated in full)\n\n4. Maximum of 300 items to be curated\n    \nCuration fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn‚Äôt matter what type of collection it is.","conclusion":"This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote üòÑ.\n\n**Voting Options**\n\n**In favor:** 4M VP to accept third parties + free slots + Reasonable curation\n\n**Against:** 1M VP to accept third parties + 500 USD slots + Curating every item in every collection","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":9884,"scores_total":3691299,"votes":30,"manaVP":1643024,"landVP":1880000,"namesVP":17800,"delegatedVP":150475,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"bfa89b30-aa01-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmcezstPnzpvHMQvDamgxBwBb7VfJNcLav8j453EQu7bMp","user":"0xfe2d424af0df49bb3316cb2e9f574b0d09cf98ad","type":"grant","title":"Building DecentralWear Community Center","start_at":"2022-03-22T17:01:00.883Z","finish_at":"2022-04-05T17:01:00.882Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Building DecentralWear Community Center","abstract":"We are a team of Decentraland community members who are passionate to give back with the mission of becoming a hub for community members to equip them with in-demand skills and develop another source of income in the Decentraland metaverse.\n\nWe have already built several projects in Decentraland, such as Play2Earn Parkour Courses, Wear2Earn Meta board Wearables, Decentraland Dating Club Love, and free DecentrAcademy Community Classes.

We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2. We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1. Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access.

This means that each item was not crafted individually by hand, but automatically generated with code, many times from traits that were previously designed and modeled. [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks), [CryptoAvatars](https://opensea.io/collection/averagepunks-) and [BAYC](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) are examples of Programmatic Collections. \n\n## Motivation\n\nIt is very unpractical, and almost impossible, to curate all the wearables in a large collection of 10k items, or more. It is also prohibitively¬†expensive for third parties. But if that collection was made programmatically, it may not be necessary to curate every item one by one. It would make much more sense to audit the **process** used to generate that collection and curate a **random portion** of the items. Like when you are boiling spaghetti, you don‚Äôt need to try them all to know when it‚Äôs ready ;)\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a proposal to introduce a new and more efficient way to curate this particular case of collections for Linked Wearables. It will make it easier and faster for the curator, shorten the time to put the collection in production, and save costs for the third parties. \n\nThe new mechanic consists of 2 parts:\n\n1. **Reviewing the method:** the curator will review the programmatic method used to create the items in the collection. If the method proves to be generating items programatically with the same base traits, it will follow up with the second step.\n2. **Reviewing items in the collection:** as the items were not created individually - but automatically with a previously validated programmatic method - there is no need to review each item in the collection. Reviewing just a random portion of the items will be enough to validate the rest. The curator will randomly choose X% items in the collection and curate only those. X% to be defined in this proposal. \n\n## Voting\n\nVote to define ‚ÄúX‚Äù, meaning the portion of the collection to be curated to consider it approved as a whole.\n\n1. **YES: X = 1%**\n2. **YES: X = 0.5%**\n3. **YES: X = 0.25%**\n4. **YES: X = 0.1%**\n5. **NO:** Decline this curation method for programmatic collections in Linked Wearables\n\n### Examples\n\n- **‚Äúx‚Äù = 1%:** If 1% of the items in the collection have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 100 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 100 wearables*\n- **‚Äúx‚Äù = 0.5%:** If 0.5% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 50 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 50 wearables*\n- **‚Äúx‚Äù = 0.25%:** If 0.25% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 3k items, then 8 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 8 wearables*\n- **‚Äúx‚Äù = 0.1%:** If 0.1% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 10 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10 wearables*\n- **NO:** If the collection has 10k items and this curation method is not implemented, then 10k items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10k wearables*\n\n*(USD 500 per wearable as defined in [the past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)). \n\nNote: consider that, if a Third Party has to pay for *all* the items in a large collection, the price could be extremely restrictive for any Third Party. For example: at current curation prices, if the collection has 10k items, the price for the curation would be 5 million US dollars!","choices":["YES: 1%","YES: 0.5%","YES: 0.25%","YES: 0.1%","NO","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":9253,"scores_total":5762576,"votes":31,"manaVP":5131271,"landVP":86000,"namesVP":2600,"delegatedVP":542705,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"d2b78c40-a08d-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmdTN1xxovCvH5VgJ2kqDb8CULB2irDZQukwc5eU4v4q5w","user":"0x5f0c7c4d0f9b4dc109f2ce986f9ca81aaad349b5","type":"grant","title":"Adding Mint #s to the Marketplace","start_at":"2022-03-10T16:19:00.772Z","finish_at":"2022-03-17T16:19:00.770Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Adding Mint #s to the Marketplace","abstract":"When in the Marketplace you cannot see the Mint #s in prior to selecting the item.

Nowadays there is no organized structure for the monetization of an event hosted in the metaverse. In order to do so we will take advantage of blockchain technology to make NFT ticketing possible in Decentraland and build an SDK to facilitate its implementation. This will bring more use cases to LAND parcels and therefore increase their value.\n\nManaging tickets as NFTs provides many advantages:\n\n- Fraud free ticket resale & ticket trading\n- Tickets sync with blockchain address\n- Royalties to organizers on each resale \n- The possibility of trading an event ticket post event because of the attached value \n- Tickets will be seen as collectibles\n- Native Integrations with Decentraland        \n\nOffering a ticketing solution will appeal to promoters and artist managers where they can easily derive revenue from sales where currently this is the unknown within virtual world experiences [being mostly free].\n\nBear in mind that we have a lot of people that want to do things on the metaverse, but they just don't know how. Now, there‚Äôs a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.\n\nOur primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:\n- Make available a NFT ticket marketplace\n- Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers\n- Increase amount of events hosted\n- Grow daily active users\n- Expand awareness in the metaverse community\n- Create more use cases for LAND owners\n- Build interest in brands sponsoring future metaverse events\n- Improve user experience for event attendees\n- Increase wearable sales\n- Surge wearable and build creations\n- Provide our building on the metaverse as a people to meet & network\n- Help make Decentraland mainstream","specification":"In order for this to be possible we are building a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.\n\nWe also have created the Events SDK that allows event organizers to give access to the event to users who have purchased tickets. \n\nLink to the Github repo: https://github.com/Fanszoid\n\nUsing our Events SDK, event organizers will also be able to:\n- Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on. \n- Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event\n- Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating a post event ticket valuation.\n- Add POAP‚Äôs to every event in one click with our seamless integration\n\nNow in-person event tickets could be attached to a Decentraland wearable. \n\nIn addition, we are communicating with the Festival District team, who worked with Decentraland on The Metaverse Festival, to see how Fanszoid could meet the future needs of promoters who need a ticketing solution. \n\nAs a final detail, we‚Äôve launched our MVP, feel free to try it out. \nhttps://app.fanszoid.com/ \n\nFor more info about our proposal you can check this presentation:\nhttps://bit.ly/Fanszoid \n\nYou can also find us at: \n\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanszoid/ \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/fanszoid \n\nWebsite - https://www.fanszoid.com/ \n\nTelegram - https://t.me/fanszoid \n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/GBv89mWgbQ","personnel":"Julian Neuss - Co-Founder & CEO - Software Engineer & crypto enthusiast.

As mentioned in the previous abstract:\n\nI have been working on a story since the early 1980s.  I used it as the background story of a virtual world game idea I embarked on in 2008.  I planned to use Mindark's Partner Planet Program for Entropia Universe.   I was not able to raise the investors and capital need to buy into a Planet Partnership.  At that time, it was $2M USD.  Since then, that price tag went up to $6M.  \n\nDuring that time, I recruited a volunteer team of designers and artists. Since we were unable to get funding, the project was shelved.  Recently, I started up again.  I successfully published the story, Children of Arla on Amazon.  My hope it to raise the funds this way.   I am also looking at Decentraland as a way to protoype the virtual world game.\n\nDuring the process from 2008 - 2014, the team fleshed out the concept, added to the base story, created art and models and built some prototype scenes in everything from Vastpark, Multiverse, CryEngine and now Unity.   Since I was never able to raise the capital we needed to solidify the contract with Mindark for the Partner Planet, I tried to build on my own in Unity.   \n\nI speant time learning C# of which, I barely am starting to understand, as well as polishing my skills at 3D design and Unity 3D.   You may learn more about the Postmoderna efforts on my website at http://www.planet-postmoderna.com and about the book as well.\n\nI am hoping to rebuild a team to continue this project.  I need capital to do this.  I see Decentraland as a possibility for a prototype.  I am an advocate for virtual economies and currencies and have been intrigued by Blockchain applications.","specification":"I have a full GDD that I am happy to share but might need an NDA to share it.

This will cover Decentraland as part of the ETHAnglia community of events, including venue hire, getting our confirmed speakers to attend including travel (including @ahoiMalloy) and having heavily marketed Decentraland terminals to experience the metaverse in person.\n\nWe appreciate that the communities will only utilise the \"terminals\" for events (we plan to integrate Metaverse into future events, but this is something we are still planning, we wanted to be explicit with our deliverables for this application).

We are able to support international speakers for the meetup (21st June) via Zoom for the fireside chat, but would love more in person speakers.\n\nPreperation for Events\n\nEvent preperation is already underway due to the scale of NorDevCon. We have full use of the room used for the web3 track on the Friday and should we be succesful, this will include the Decentraland terminals, as well as live interviews for content creation.\n\nDuring this phase, we would need to spec and purchase the computers for free use at the events on Decentraland. Decide what activities, if any, we promote to engage within the Metaverse. Create banners to sit above the Decentraland area promoting what is happening. In previous years at NorDevCon, high score events on driving simulators have gained huge traction. We would love similar to occur for the Decentraland, with MANA being a prize.\n\nFor the 21st July event, we will need to source a venue (in discussions for ITFC in Ipswich), arrange food and drinks, arrange ticketing (both Meetup and via Unlock Protocol).\n\nDelivery\n\nSounds simple, but the delivery portion will make sure that members of the team are manning, organising and reviewing the use of the areas and making sure the maximum number of people are getting a good overview and use of the computers.

This prevents the ‚Äúexpressiveness‚Äù of the community from leading the charge and bringing amazing things to the ecosystem. As the wearable market flourished once opened to the community by removing the centrality of wearable creation/publishing.\n\nSolution:\nJust as we have done with wearables, we should open nft emotes for creators to load their .fbx and other standardized movement files to be used by their avatars. This in turn would not only add a whole other dimension for creators to utilize, but it would also allow for additional revenues to return to the DAO from submission fees and royalties. This would add a new class of asset for Decentraland‚Äôs current and future users.\n\nImportance of movement:\nScience shows that a majority of how we communicate is through body language, and without allowing the community of creators to inject their creativity through that medium we are holding our users back in the very area we are trying to open to them; deep and meaningful ways to connect and communicate with others online. \n\nCase Study to Demonstrate Feasibility:\nSome barriers which have limited this from being a possibility is the access to movement data, which often is not very simple to access whether due to cost or proprietary reasons. For this reason it has been easier to have the movements hard coded, and as special surprises through the year. \n\nWith the expansion of uses within the web3 space, a new company MetaMoves has published NFTs which give the holder owner of the actual movement data, with standard files such as .fbx. They are already utilizing this to animate other avatars such as MeeBits, and the same could be realized for Decentraland Users. It would allow us to carry into Decentraland an important part of our identity. That goofy wave or dance move; if you don‚Äôt speak I may think you are shy, but if you stop moving‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll call an ambulance! Movement has a deep connection to being alive, let‚Äôs liberate movement and help Decentraland accomplish something no other metaverse has before.","choices":["Yes - I would like for the Decentraland Developement Team to prioritize building a UI/UX for creators to load in their own movements.

This will include the topics to be covered and duration.\n\nMilestone 2: March 11th - May 31st - Preperation for Events\n\nDeliverables for this will be the outline of how the events will run as a document. This will demonstrate the use of the computers, what will be running (i.e. Decentraland event), how long each person will get to try out Decentraland. \n\nWe will through the phase agree internally the specifcation for the computers, as well as the marketing for Decentraland (we are currently thinking a wide banner to sit above the terminals). This will be agreed with Decentraland.\n\nWe will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.\n\nMilestone 3: Delivery\n\nDeliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":8054,"scores_total":975134,"votes":28,"manaVP":45093,"landVP":220000,"namesVP":77000,"delegatedVP":633041,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"4c1eb3b0-8bfd-11ec-b2d8-691324a163a7","snapshot_id":"QmYfRrHdvxvbVHCfAcMrXXrjmMVG815GFUe2N1NyDdTP4i","user":"0x547849942c3ea64151986b77fe2a34b8cd569d6f","type":"grant","title":"customer accusistion","start_at":"2022-02-12T12:14:00.171Z","finish_at":"2022-02-19T12:14:00.170Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"customer accusistion","abstract":"Well - ive corrected the bug in windows 11 that was making it difficult for many pc users to use xbox one/x controllers on their PC- giving  you  the ability to  operate your PC with the controller independently,  without the aid of a KB or mouse , every bit as efficientl  y as you would on a xbox or playstation- on windows, system wide.

To viewing it as, \"its right there-, ill give it a shot, why not\"... and anyone thats had xbox live understands the mental process im speaking of.  I personally believe providing this to users would result in more users opting to try Decentraland than just about any other ad campaign- im almost certain of that.

The only action Decentraland‚Äôs DAO would have is setting up a new contract that points the secondary fees from OpenSea et al to the new L1 Wearables DAO.\n\nUpon creation of the DAO, an L1 Wearable snapshot would be taken, and holders of L1 wearables, prior and up to the snapshot being taken, would be issued governance tokens for the DAO.\n\nThe DAO could then vote on dispersing those funds to holders of the governance token, delegating them to a representative, and voting on other project initiatives such as creating an L1 Wearables Museum in Decentraland.\n\nFor the L1 Wearables DAO Governance Token proposal, I think we can get more granular, in terms of token weightings, by creating a more complex algorithm based on factors like:\n\nOwns more than 2 items from multiple collections\nHas sold an items on OpenSea/Decentraland‚Äôs Marketplace\nNFT Count\nWeighted Collection Date Average (ie are most of your L1 wearables from the first collection or last collections on L1 ‚Äì were you an early adopter)\n\n[Closing Remarks]\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback. \n\nWe need to push forward as a community and L1 wearables has quite the storied past.

Here, they pegged the NFT price to USD and also did not accept MANA.\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-binance-against-covid19/\n\nThose who were asked to purchased NFT wearables in MANA for the Halloween 2019 collection were hurt the most by this decision.\n\nMajority of the collection was sold, not acquired via play-to-earn methods. The prices were as follows:\n\nMythic Items: 5,000 MANA\nLegendary Items: 500 MANA\nEpic Items: 100 MANA\n\nThe items and original address can be found here:\nhttps://opensea.io/0x93a7c46443901c2ea2fc1263a4d076f470695d3a?tab=created&search[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE&search[resultModel]=ASSETS&search[sortAscending]=true\n\nUpon the launch of this predominantly-purchase only collection, admins in Decentraland‚Äôs Discord ‚Äúadvertised‚Äù how to access OpenSea and buy these items set at the *market* price, which turned out to not be sticky.\n\n2.\tDeveloper/Admin/Foundation Member(s) of Decentraland sold their wearable NFTs to the community in exchange for MANA, often farming them before other community members could acquire them. There‚Äôs on-chain and YouTube history of this for the Xmas 2019 and Moonshot 2020 events.\n\nTo gain bipartisanship in this matter, I will withhold naming these particular members of the team for now and not share the recently curated Google Doc detailing the advertisement of wearables on OpenSea and Admins selling them to the community. Nonetheless, it is disappointing how certain individuals dumped on the community and rose to prominent positions within the DAO without any recourse or apologizing.\n\nIt is imperative to highlight this issue, as it showcases the poorly designed incentives that members of the team have to care about the L1 Wearable community, as many have sold a good portion of their NFTs, especially their earliest, most rare mints. \n\nAs an ombudsman for the wearables community, a resounding comment that has been made frequently is: ‚ÄúPaper hands are never rewarded, and the community expresses little sorrow in knowing that we had higher expectations of this project than those members of the project who dumped their NFTs on the community.‚Äù\n\n[PROPOSAL]\n\nNow that we‚Äôve cleared the air on the points of contention, let‚Äôs jump into the proposed solutions.\n\n1.\tGrant Wearables Voting Power\n\nA flat amount of voting power per each L1 Wearable is the simplest solution, as the devs have mentioned; even though, Decentraland‚Äôs unique property design for wearables complicates this.\n\nDAO Weighting for L1 Holders:\n\nAccording to the data I pulled from GraphQL (this data should be validated by the community), the distribution is as follows for rarity type:\n\nUnique             |\t             4   |         0.005%\nMythic\t     |          984   |       1.224%\nLegendary     |   13,229   |    16.449%\nEpic\t             |   28,775   |    35.780%\nRare\t             |   25,713   |    31.972%\nUncommon   |     6,309   |        7.845%\nCommon\t     |     5,409   |         6.726%\nTotal\t             |  80,423   |      100.00%\n\nWe sit on the shoulders of giants; those who came before us. Under this premise, I feel that pioneers of Decentraland should be rewarded for their time and bravery. For those just joining the community, there have been many moments along this journey where community members have shared losses.\n\nVoting Power should be assigned in a two-tier ranking system, in an easy to assign manner for the Decentraland developers.\n\nWith this in mind, I propose a two-tier Voting Power weight.\nBeing the first collection, the Exclusive Mask collection, stands out in this regard. In addition, since the Halloween 2019 collection was a primary-purchase only collection, which hindered the democratic of many L1 holders, this collection should also be in that tier.\n\nBeing that the Xmas 2019 was a bugfest, I also propose including this collection into that same standalone tier. Lastly, to be included, should be the MCH (MyCryptoHeroes) collection, especially after some of the collection was incorrectly listed under the Mythic background color, which hurt many buyers. \n\nAll four of these collections were minted in 2019. Please note the 2019 weightings coincide with prices that Decentraland charged for the Halloween 2019 collection, save for rare(s) which were not sold but scales with proposed mint count.\n\n2019 Collections                    | Voting Power\nMythic/Exclusive Masks    | 5000\nLegendary/MCH                     | 500\nEpic\t                                           | 100\nRare\t                                           | 10\nUncommon\t\t                   | N/A\nCommon\t\t                           | N/A\n\n>2019 Collections                 | Voting Power\nUnique/Mythic                        | 1000\nLegendary                                   | 100\nEpic\t                                           | 10\nRare\t                                           | 2\nUncommon\t\t                   | 1\nCommon\t\t                           | 1\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback. \n\nWe need to push forward as a community and this has been quite the gray cloud. I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market.

It's time for the community to rally and restore faith in Decentraland's wearables.\n\nLet's promote and push for the revitalization of these historical pieces of art in Decentraland and the blockchain space, before the next 10,000 opts for Meta as their only platform.\n \nCheers,\nSuperMANA","choices":["Approve Voting Power for Wearables","Reject Proposal","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7706,"scores_total":1086347,"votes":15,"manaVP":1078,"landVP":82000,"namesVP":17300,"delegatedVP":985968,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"fe9124a0-8857-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmWd4gpktWMUL8WCL3akMza7YBLyMjoqFHWqaa9o114Vnj","user":"0x4cb45d74b891db3ae1ceadda55491a58aea6371c","type":"grant","title":"The Statue of Love (The statue of Mikasa Ackerman)","start_at":"2022-02-07T20:53:00.610Z","finish_at":"2022-02-14T20:53:00.609Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"The Statue of Love (The statue of Mikasa Ackerman)","abstract":"\"Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.\"\n- CONFUCIUS.\n\n\n \nLove is one of the most powerful forces in the world.

DCL implements a smart contract to mint a corresponding NFT for each subdomain and allow the NFT owner to claim the subdomain (in case of transfers). These NFTs are then used to identify if a user owns the name or not, and if they do, they can set it as their Avatar Name.\n\n\nWith a few changes, DCL can allow subdomains of the dcl names to be minted as NFTs and integrate them into the naming system to allow names like xxx.name (the corresponding ENS subdomain would be xxx.name.dcl.eth)\n\nThe Name Registry smart contract is already designed in such a way that it could theoretically work to mint subdomains for any base domain (or subdomain). Implementing this change would just require a slightly modified version of this contract to exist along with the base names. NFTs generated through new smart contracts can then be included in the naming system.\n\nNote: if someone wants to enable subdomains for their name, they would have to transfer ownership of the name to a smart contract.","choices":["Allow subdomain names for DCL names to be registered","Do not allow it","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7480,"scores_total":756620,"votes":43,"manaVP":34181,"landVP":288000,"namesVP":278200,"delegatedVP":156239,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"1fa3dec0-8525-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmVEReUNCgebmyzNjpArhXbC1rjVUpS8VZn89NZocCps4Q","user":"0x90db61232fd019a7083876f3d0a649799135f8f6","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -23,-2 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-03T19:11:00.276Z","finish_at":"2022-02-10T19:11:00.274Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-23,"y":-2,"type":"add_poi","description":"GenesisProud is the very first Metaverse space for the LGBTQ community.

The DAO facilitator‚Äôs support in the drafting of the proposal is not an endorsement. This is a Draft Proposal, and will require 2M Votes to be promoted to the final voting stage.*\n\n**Summary:**\n \nWe are proposing that Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program. Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:** \n\nOlympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs while offering users discounted tokens in return. At the time of writing, Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity.\n\n**What are the protocol benefits of this new bonding mechanism?**\n\nFor the protocols there are a number of benefits. One of the primary benefits is creating a new revenue stream for the DAO. By owning the liquidity, the DAO will start to capture the trading fees. At the time of this writing the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nAdditionally, since there is no longer a need for extreme inflationary token incentives MANA will have a protected liquidity floor. This helps to protect from illiquid markets and creates a better trading experience for token-holders due to minimal slippage.\n\nFinally, the Olympus Pro program helps Decentraland gain exposure to the Olympus community! Decentraland and Olympus are two of the biggest communities in the Metaverse and DeFi industry. We believe it would be the perfect partnership to broaden both communities and to create a truly powerful decentralized ecosystem for both Olympus and Decentraland.\n\n**Motivation:** \n\n*What are the benefits for the community?*\nGives the community the opportunity to buy discounted (~5-10%) tokens in exchange for providing the protocol a liquidity position. This provides a truly positive sum interaction between the protocol and community. In typical liquidity mining the protocol pays out their token for individuals/entities to temporarily provide liquidity. With Olympus Pro the Decentraland still pays out it‚Äôs token but receives an LP/asset in return. A win-win for both parties!\n\nAdditionally, the community will not have to suffer through impermanent loss. Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair. With Olympus Pro they simply provide an LP position to the protocol and receive MANA in return! The MANA is linearly vested over a typical time period of 7 days - meaning the discounted MANA accrues over a 7 day period, and can be used freely at the end of this period.\n\n*How can it help Decentraland?*\nControlling Decentraland‚Äôs own liquidity will support sustainable growth and can create new revenue streams for opening reward emissions for its users. \nIncreased revenue streams for the further development of the protocol. For example, on December 6, trading fees on X for the ETH-MANA LP pair were $12,060 USD. If Decentraland owned the liquidity for this pair, these fees would go to the DAO treasury.  \nRemoves the need to create high inflationary rewards for liquidity mining \nAllowing multiple bond pairs with MANA (reserve or LP) would diversify your treasury, thus allowing for more complex DeFi strategies to create sustainable growth that is essential for these protocols to keep incentivizing users to play the game\nControlling your own liquidity decreases your dependency toward financial backing (VCs, private investors, etc) and gives more power to the DAO and its community\nThe tokens which Olympus earns as fees (3.3%) will never be sold and the community is willing to delegate the governance to entities voted on by the decentraland community\nPotential integration of Olympus within the Decentraland metaverse\n\nCurrent status of the Olympus Pro Program and it‚Äôs partners:\n\nWe have over 24 deployed partner projects on Olympus Pro with over 100 pending applications \nSome notable bond contracts which have amassed large amounts of total bond volume (TBV) are:\nAlchemix - $4.37M\nFrax - $1.97M\nPendle - $1.52M\nShapeshift FOX - $933K \nStake DAO - $877K\n\nOlympus Pro: https://pro.olympusdao.finance/\n\nA Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Navigating Olympus Pro: \nhttps://olympusdao.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-navigating-olympus-pro-5b1a9b710075 \n\n\n**Specification:**\n\nFor: Create partnership with Olympus Pro\n \nAgainst: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro","choices":["For: Create partnership with Olympus Pro","Against: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7426,"scores_total":531596,"votes":21,"manaVP":21696,"landVP":10000,"namesVP":73900,"delegatedVP":426000,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"b21e91f0-84f3-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmeJCjr2fSHgcTC5D3hv9chH2rZeNGfeKWYo1nZUrQ5LNw","user":"0x3098529f929c1ced32f06b8d3df47082597af7a8","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -91,-84 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-03T13:17:00.191Z","finish_at":"2022-02-10T13:17:00.189Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-91,"y":-84,"type":"add_poi","description":"The Vienna Art Gallery is coming to Decentraland. \nEnjoy frequent Meet & Greets with our photo artists and painters. \nJoin our mixed reality events or just come over and enjoy the art.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":7413,"scores_total":506532,"votes":10,"manaVP":44032,"landVP":36000,"namesVP":500,"delegatedVP":426000,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"d6e15b80-84d0-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmXxc9BLzcFvuVgFXEGoJwELpakEpjVS3W2spsamp4xzVd","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"poll","title":"Should Yannakis be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?","start_at":"2022-02-03T09:08:00.480Z","finish_at":"2022-02-08T09:08:00.478Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Should Yannakis be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?","description":"## Description\n\nWhile the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed.

The domain chosen is a big decision as it becomes part of that entities brand. There's a big difference in brand effect from being beer.eth(https://bit.ly/3o7UgWH/) to b33r.eth. I believe mana.eth to be a strong contender for ideal domain for decentraland dao.\nI believe being forward thinking and swift moving is this area is going to be massively beneficial. As the market begins noticing increased demand, like any piece of scarce digital property, the prices could be driven up quite high. I think that's why people have been willing to pay a premium to secure powerful/clean domains(https://bit.ly/3s3oP15).\nSomething I would just like to point out, that I don't think has been realized yet, is the power of subdomains. The dao would be able to issue everyone their own subdomain of their choosing (i.e. jack.mana.eth, sage.mana.eth, etc) which the person could then put in their twitter profiles and such to show their support of the dao - I believe this will become very common place in the future.\nWe're still very much in the nascent stages of ENS development. Only a few coins can be assigned an address but in the future you should be able to send any coin to an ens address, from any chain and layer. Right now it seems dao's are largely sleeping on the importance of a domain, but once again I think in the future nearly every dao will want one.\n\nAs the current owner of mana.eth, my motivations are obvious, but I also strongly believe in the future of digital identity that ENS is building towards. I'm hoping to reach those who also believe in that future and perhaps have a bit of influence in the dao and encourage you to light the fire in this area and get your domain secured - whatever you collectively end up deciding it to be.\n\nP.S. - I've just found the dao already owns dcl.eth that it uses on its backend for ingame name registrations I believe? Well if the dao doesn't wish to use ENS in a public way, that's its own decision. But if I had a strong position in the dao, I'm absolutely certain of what my preference would be - I would want mana.eth shown on the dao's twitter page, and I would want as many members putting their subdomain in their twitter profile(and other socials) as possible. And I would want it to look like jack.mana.eth  over  jack.dcl.eth - one is very clear support for decentraland, the other is ambiguous and would clearly need the acronym explained until its understood what it is.","choices":["yes","no","maybe in the future","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7189,"scores_total":105014,"votes":11,"manaVP":70514,"landVP":32000,"namesVP":2500,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"51cae350-81fe-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb","snapshot_id":"QmbquFCDxLv3TJzvCKSEtMNPs7Lz18XdEKw5Y2nRZe2wZn","user":"0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99c698d4b1fe1aa0599346","type":"poll","title":"Should Wearables Including Guns Be Allowed?","start_at":"2022-01-30T18:56:00.558Z","finish_at":"2022-02-04T18:56:00.556Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Should Wearables Including Guns Be Allowed?","description":"Should Guns/Knifes attached to wearables be accepted.

We are very disappointed to see this being embraced so early in what was touted to be a censorship resistant environment.\n\nBeing offended is subjective so even the most innocuous names could be perceived as being offensive by any individual or group at any time.  E.g. Snowflake, Cracker, Yellow, Red, Brave, Monkey just to name a few.\n\nThe idea: Unban all banned names and switch to a user controlled ecosystem where each individual has the ability to decide on their own what they want or don't want to see similar to chat.  This gives users more control over their experience without anyone being subjected to or coerced by reddit/twitter style outrage mobs, while preventing endless future dao votes on the subject as people start to add or change characters over time to circumvent these blanket bans.\n\nWe believe this to be the most reasonable solution to restore censorship resistance and confidence within Decentraland while granting ALL users the ability to have control over who and what they want to see. If you deem something offensive all you will have to do is press a couple of buttons and it's no longer an issue.\n\nTo allow name banning in such a frivolous manner is to allow and reinforce prejudice by definition (not to mention the inefficiencies that come with voting and banning each name that someone happens to find offensive) As citizens of Decentraland, we believe users should be blocked and/or ostracized based on their actions; not what they refer to themselves as while also leaving the door open for any individual user to block any username/user they don't like without any time being wasted on feelings based votes and blanket bans that are far too often passed as a result of a single user having sufficient vp to get their way. This is neither healthy nor sustainable; the slippery slope is very real.\n\nThere are many recent examples that support our assertions. \n\nTo allow such censorship is to repeat the very mistakes blockchains intended to solve, thereby making it directly contradictory to the Ethos of Decentraland and cryptocurrency in general.

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help Pawnfi devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what Pawnfi plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we‚Äôll hire UI Designer to help to build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understands that it is not user-friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It‚Äôs vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.\n\nFor more details, please refer to product deck: https://drive.google.com/file/d/176naRyblIEVbvJ8NqV5VMbbm65feugAc/view?usp=sharing","personnel":"### Wesley - Chief Executive Officer\n\nCFA Charterholder with more than 5-year experience in investment and banking industry, leading security Lending & Borrowing business.

The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe entire grant will be used to acquire land(1 parcel) that we have recognized as a good location to begin our development.

While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies. \n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access. \n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.","specification":"The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first.

They bring a bit of pizazz to DCL and make the world feel that much more alive. But all too often, events are completely neglected by their hosts -- people stay up late and gather around spaces, only to find that nothing is actually happening on the land. There are also many events that occupy top real estate on the events page for *weeks*, but the event has actually concluded ages ago.\n\nThis is very frustrating and while DCL veterans may tolerate it to an extent, I feel this is extremely detrimental to the growth of the user base. I've brought new people into DCL before for events, and because the event doesn't happen (either it's delayed or completely forgotten about), the new players get frustrated and never touch DCL again. \n\nI suspect some event hosts use the valuable real estate on the events page to market their products/services and don't actually intend on delivering the activities they promise. Who really knows - it's all conjecture. Nonetheless, I think users should have a way of upvoting or downvoting events so that hosts are held responsible for delivering quality experiences.\n\nTL;DR: Implement upvoting/downvoting system for events.","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":5922,"scores_total":416579,"votes":15,"manaVP":8249,"landVP":88000,"namesVP":5200,"delegatedVP":315129,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"b877ba80-75fe-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmdiZW9t6BQ9cex2zSbFLRZ4ftJNqQXyqSKEDSbvetm6be","user":"0xbda5d0f22bca7b0af635bd3efc720759d1c2dfb2","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Sarai","start_at":"2022-01-15T12:29:00.865Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T12:29:00.864Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Sarai","description":"kjhgiuyiyugvbyuidnfgmnfghmfhmhfmmjfhmth ,jh","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":5920,"scores_total":639967,"votes":6,"manaVP":80253,"landVP":240000,"namesVP":4600,"delegatedVP":315113,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"b292a260-75fe-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmQrmUPc9MKPdF6FtGjEyHpGoAPbjrUPHK2v6NfbVrVw7h","user":"0xbda5d0f22bca7b0af635bd3efc720759d1c2dfb2","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Sarai","start_at":"2022-01-15T12:28:00.974Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T12:28:00.974Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Sarai","description":"kjhgiuyiyugvbyuidnfgmnfghmfhmhfmmjfhmth ,jh","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":5921,"scores_total":403119,"votes":4,"manaVP":1306,"landVP":82000,"namesVP":4700,"delegatedVP":315113,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"6ee04650-75f2-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmeVQQzr3PDaf5EpMnKz7D2w2zu5vSwJh1aCweXqZBUuNW","user":"0x0749d1abb5ca9128432b612644c0ea1e9c6cc9af","type":"poll","title":"Decentraland News Network?","start_at":"2022-01-15T11:01:00.437Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T11:01:00.437Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Decentraland News Network?","description":"Do you think we should have a Decentraland News Network?

More details and specifications in the original [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) for Third Party Wearables.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nDefine a *fair* *slot* price (each Wearable needs one slot) for Third Parties to upload item representations of their NFTs¬†and a *fair* *commission* *fee* for the Curators that will make sure these representations comply with Decentraland UI guidelines and aesthetics.\n\n**Specification**\n\nAfter the Third Party is added to the Third Party Registry as defined in the previous [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240), the Third Party Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and buy one *slot* for each NFT they want their community to have inside Decentraland.\n\nLet use an example: [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/) (or any other NFT Collection) may want their NFT owners to have a cool stoner hat that is only available for them, a wearable that represents their community and culture. So representatives from CCC could request the DAO to add them as an accepted Third Party to the Third Party Registry. This is the first step, then the Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and start the process.\n\nThe CCC Managers can add 3D models that will represent the stoner hat wearable, but in order to do so, they need to buy one slot for each model. If they only want to give their NFT Owners one single hat for each of them, then they need to buy just one slot. If they want to create a collection of many different models, they need to buy one slot for each one.\n\n\n**MANA collected from the slots purchases will got to DAO's Treasury and be used for:**\n\n- Curation fees for the Curators Committee\n- Cover storage costs for the 3D models\n\n**There are a few things to consider before setting the slots price and commissions:**\n\n- Price will be paid in MANA, but it will be pegged to the US Dollar.\n- Collections that were designed in a procedural way (this means that each 3D representation is created by using an algorithm like Bored Apes, Cannabis Club, etc) are not going to be curated individually. For example: if the collection has 10k [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), and they were created in a procedural way, curators will only review a portion of the Collection and review the process used to create it. If it is compliant, the whole collection will be approved. Curators will receive commissions for the portion of the collection reviewed.\n- If the collection was not created in a procedural way, every item has to be curated individually.\n\nThis feature, Third Party Wearables, implies a new way to get closer to **interoperability**. Many strong communities with valuable NFTs would be able to let their members enjoy them inside Decentraland.\n\n**Voting options**\n\n1. Slot Price: USD 300 / Commission for Curators: USD 50 \n2. Slot Price: USD 400 / Commission for Curators: USD 50 \n3. Slot Price: USD 500 / Commission for Curators: USD 50 \n*(similar to [new fee structure](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) for regular wearables)*\n4.

Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:** Olympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs (e.g. MANA-ETH) while offering users discounted tokens in return. Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity. One of the primary benefits of the Olympus Pro program is that it can create a new revenue stream for the DAO, by owning MANA-ETH liquidity and starting  to capture the trading fees. At the time when this proposal was written, the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nOlympus Pro is the partnership program of Olympus DAO.

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform.

This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place when go live and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment.

Despite this, we managed to write our own program for the cryptocurrency exchanger, which stands out with speed and security.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchanger is a central part of the entire ecosphere. We designed program so that it would be as easy to connect other services (for example, integrate the exchanger into the marketplace).\n\n## Other projects in system\n\n**Processing** - The user remains on the site, he doesn't need to go to external systems. This will speed up the payment processing from our side.\n\n**Acquiring**  - Our own acquiring will allow us to reduce commissions for our clients. Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.\n\n**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.\n\n**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds. The benefits for sellers and buyers are the same as in the marketplace - the services are interconnected and there are no commissions.\n\nOne of our team members is a certified economist with experience in large banks, so the economic model of our cryptocurrency exchanger is working and already brings some profit.\nFor other services, the economic model is also already being worked out.\n\nBut having a small team imposes its own limitations. We can't work on both the backend and the frontend at the same time. Therefore, the design and functionality in some moments lags behind the competitors.\n\n## So, we need funds for\n* **Programmers** - to work in parallel on several modules;\n\n* **Web designer** - to improve the usability of all services;\n\n* **Lawyer** - to resolve disputes and protect us and our partners;\n\n* **Marketing and sales department** - to promote services.\n\n## Links:\n1.

At the same time, the user's avatar will be able to make exchanges both in the common space and in a private room - an analogue of a personal account on the site during registration. In addition to notification of a successful exchange, the avatar will be issued checks in Decentraland.\n\nWe want to visualize the exchange itself, as it can happen in reality with a virtual cashier. It will ensure maximum realism.\nAfter that, the visual space of the bank will be created with cashiers, operators, etc. That is, the user will get the full feeling of being in the bank. Virtual contracts will also be created.\n\nThe exchange itself will be carried out through an exchange office, where neuroblockchain technology is being developed, taking into account the possibility of hidden transfers, transfers without confirmation, transfers with confirmation and multitracts.

It will allow us more long term ability to add new contributors, provide educational, hands-on opportunities for more creators in our collective to learn and engage with Decentraland.","specification":"We will complete this project internally with the 7 team members, our larger network of collaborators and partners, and the additional 8 granted collaborators. \n\nPlease view our previous projects here: \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fractilians\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/boomboxheads","personnel":"Annie Stardust - \n - Founder of IRL Art, Digital Artist and Art Director working primarily in Cinema 4D, with a background in animation, content development, 3D world building, early NFT artist, onboarded over 400 artists into NFTs, and art steward for ETHDenver since 2019. \n\nYultek - Multimedia Artist, Graphic Designer, Metaverse Architect, AR/VR content producer - Lead designer and installer for IRLart - @yultek_\n\nGodfrey - Virtual Reality Developer, Crypto Artist working in 3d / VR, Virtual Production, Virtual Art Galleries, VR Music Videos, Music Producer, Real-TIme Production and Streaming\n\nFractilians - Digital + Analog  Visual Arts Educator + Content Creation. 3D/VR , Streaming, Video production.

This is due to early adopters scooping up most of these premium/platinum names during the official launch in 2020. Lately I am noticing almost all new users with guest names. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is affordability due to requiring 100 Mana + Gas to claim a name. Another reason is most likely because the name they want has already been claimed by another user. Perhaps the last reason is name price on the secondary market is well above their threshold. \n\nHere is why I believe there should be a marketplace for leasing DCL Names:\n\n- Allow new users to experience what it feels like owning a name at 1/10th or 1/100th of the actual minting price.\n\n- Give someone the pleasure of having their dream name inside the metaverse.\n\n- Provide awareness, liquidity,  volume & activity in names market.\n\n- Incentive and passive income for anyone who owns two names or more.\n\n- Possibility for leasing names in L2 Polygon (Matic) with almost no fees. (technically may or may not be possible)\n\n- Great model for pop-up, one time events where that name is required or relevant for that event.\n\n\nLeasing options can be 1 day, 1 week, 1 month etc..

The real value that it offers for users turns out to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with them provides.\n\nWe aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added value to the participants.

There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services.

We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs.

Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we‚Äôll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we‚Äôve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It‚Äôs vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can‚Äôt see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game ‚ÄúKingfisher‚Äù, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future.

As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2. \n\n\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"Byldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:\n\n1. Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\nByldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2. Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.","personnel":"### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

Proposals must meet specific criteria before they may be moved to the next stage. The end result is a binding governance decision.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCommunity ‚ÄúPolls‚Äù are the only mechanism at this time for the community to vote on complicated governance issues, for example, on issues surrounding voting power, fee structures, and other socio-economic dynamics. The poll category is designed to be a non-binding gauge of community perceptions, not a binding governance proposal. However, in response to community feedback, the DAO Committee has taken on the practice of implementing polls as policy, in the absence of a more formal voting mechanism.\n\nThis is problematic for three reasons. First, the poll format does not allow time for consensus building and adequate assessment of impacts and implementation pathways. Second, there are no restrictions on who can submit a community poll, leading to spam proposals and there are no voting power thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on voting power). Finally, because polls are non-binding, their implementation has become dependent on the DAO committee, undermining the efficacy of the DAO and confidence in our governance process. \n\nThis proposal aims to establish a three-tiered voting process that begins with a ‚Äúcommunity poll‚Äù in its current form, and ends in a binding ‚Äúgovernance proposal.‚Äù\n\n\n**Specification **\n\nThe voting process will include three tiers: Pre-Proposal Poll, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds.\n\n***Stage 1: Pre-Proposal Poll***\n \nThe purpose of the Pre-Proposal Poll is to introduce a governance issue to the community, gauge community sentiment, and determine if there is enough support to move forward with the drafting of an initial proposal. Pre-Proposal Polls can only pass to the Draft Proposal stage if they have accumulated a threshold of at least 500K VP. A poll that reaches at least 500K VP and does *not* garner a majority of participating voting power, may *still* advance to the Draft Proposal stage - ensuring all issues with enough support have an initial pathway toward passage into policy.  \n\nPolls do not need to be composed in any specific form. They can be drafted in the full proposal format, or be presented as a straightforward question. Polls are currently the only option we have for governance issues that fall outside the established categories (Grants, name ban, catalysts and POIs).\n\n- Submission Threshold: 100 VP (i.e. equivalent to one name)\n- Passage Threshold: 500K VP\n- Voting Period: 5 Days\n\n\n***Stage 2: Draft Proposal*** \n\nThe purpose of the Draft Proposal is to present a potential policy to the community in a structured format and to formalize discussion about a proposal's potential impacts and implementation pathways. Draft Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 1), and can only pass to the binding Governance Proposal stage with a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power with a threshold of at least 1M VP. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time.\n\n- Submission Threshold: 1,000 VP (or delegated VP)\n- Passage Threshold: 1M VP\n- Voting Period: 1 Week\n\n\n***Stage 3: Binding Governance Proposal*** \n\nThe purpose of the Governance Proposal is to formalize the passed version of a Draft Proposal  into a binding governance outcome. Only established or recognized community members can submit Governance Proposals, which are only passed if they reach the needed acceptance criteria for their category. In the interim period before new voting categories have been established (and for proposals that do not have a pre-set category) a Governance Proposal must receive a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power and at least 6M VP to pass as a binding decision.  \n\nProcesses and thresholds for established categories will not be changed as part of this proposal. Meaning, the process for grants, POIs, etc‚Ä¶ will remain unchanged. Additional categories for specific types of issues, e,g, ‚Äúfee structures,‚Äù will be proposed, and relevant processes and thresholds developed. \n\nGovernance Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 2).\n\n- Submission Threshold: 2,500 VP (or delegated VP)\n- Passage Threshold: 6M VP (or needed acceptance criteria for their category)\n- Voting Period: 2 Weeks\n\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nDAO Governance should be agile and responsive, however, at the same time tempered and deliberative. In its current form, important community decisions are being made on a week-to-week basis, and through non-binding community polls. The proposed voting framework will moderate the pace of our self-government and facilitate a detailed and deliberative process to ensure we make informed and representative decisions.\n\n(Annex outlying Draft & Governance Proposal format provided in forum)","choices":["For (1): Establish a three-tiered binding Governance Proposal process","For (2): Modify current use of Community Polls, however, amend this proposal","Against: Do Nothing/Maintain current use of Community Polls","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3584,"scores_total":3584605,"votes":39,"manaVP":916092,"landVP":2268000,"namesVP":85400,"delegatedVP":315113,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"48d015f0-5bce-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174","snapshot_id":"QmdzCGj7GEQX6jjCGLo1CuzmKrN98u2GAnbMgubUhbXiyH","user":"0x11406a7317579bd4527f21f9ac5b5c46745a9706","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Impossible","start_at":"2021-12-13T04:36:00.463Z","finish_at":"2021-12-20T04:36:00.463Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Impossible","description":"The word ‚ÄúImpossible‚Äù shall not exist in Decentraland, merely this word is offensive to the foundation of MVR","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3569,"scores_total":835740,"votes":33,"manaVP":110427,"landVP":304000,"namesVP":106200,"delegatedVP":315113,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"053ea670-5b61-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174","snapshot_id":"QmSFhCKUrQ1EUEP25XzZGkTP9rM9dzxac4GAYrQp1ucK36","user":"0x60d7ef00900ed962146b96b16e2df1036c9e09f2","type":"poll","title":"Allow users to also upload their own wearable to dress their own avatar.","start_at":"2021-12-12T15:34:00.960Z","finish_at":"2021-12-19T15:34:00.960Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Allow users to also upload their own wearable to dress their own avatar.","description":"Hi, I would like for users who can design their own wearables to be allowed to upload the files and dress their avatar ; Then these uploaded items COULD  or COULDN't be available for sale to others that can't design but love an avatar wearable which is not in the market place they can ask to purchase the item direct from user and not just from market place.

Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.","specification":"This module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land).

Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n \n**Kingfisher social fishing game**\nSome of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game ‚ÄúKingfisher‚Äù, which is a social fishing game.

The majority of Decentraland being underdeveloped may be a result of land owners not having the skills or resources needed to develop the amazing experiences we all know Decentraland is capable of rendering.\n\nTo address the underdeveloped land and lack of high-quality user engagement zones, should the marketplace be expanded to match two new sets of market participants?\n- Match land owners  with renters\n- Match people who need DCL developers  with people who specialize in DCL development (modeling, blockchain programming, game developers, etc...)\n\nI think this is an easy extension to the Decentraland marketplace that would significantly increase the amount of development in DCL, which would increase the number of active members.

Each of these names currently has 100 voting power. If we reduce the cost of the names, does the voting power also drop? Does it drop just for those that claim a name for a lower price? If so, who will track which names were claimed at full price and which were claimed at reduced price to determine voting power? If the voting power is reduced for all names including those that were claimed for 100 MANA, then it will create an inequity in voting power distribution.\n\n2. Owning an NFT name is not a requirement for participating in any activities in Decentraland. It is purely optional. In fact, anyone can enter Decentraland and use any name of their choice at any time for free. It will just have several additional characters added at the end as an extension. Therefore, I question the need to reduce the price of names at all.\n\n3. It seems that virtually every day there are several names claimed for 100 MANA each. If people are willing to continue to pay 100 MANA to claim a name then there should be no reason to reduce the price.\n\n4. Many of those that claimed one or more of the 30,000 existing names for 100 MANA did so as an investment. These are NFT‚Äôs that have value. If the cost of claiming a named is dropped, it will completely change the value structure of these NFT‚Äôs.

From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself.

I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven. \n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.","roadmap":"Beginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3215,"scores_total":1614235,"votes":34,"manaVP":97278,"landVP":1170000,"namesVP":23500,"delegatedVP":323457,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"ebfe3f80-5350-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmXq2Y8JZDdegYPL1giTUokow5wfDzzK3MeSNEDb1hXa7a","user":"0xfa61a917133e27b5053fd4ae97e3910c9ca99f8c","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -48,103 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-12-02T09:19:00.344Z","finish_at":"2021-12-09T09:19:00.344Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":-48,"y":103,"description":"CollecOnline‚Äôs Virtual Gallery is an evolving space that features international artists, NFTs, real-world artworks, and collectibles.

(Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the [DAO's vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.\n\nAs of the time this proposal was published,  `34,857,497` of that MANA is now available to the DAO's treasury. At a current market value of ~150,000,00 USD.\n\nThe Treasury also has 5,392,411 USD in stable coins at the moment used to fund grants. The original proposal to convert 1/5 of the Treasury to stablecoins [was approved here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372).\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) specifies new grant tiers to be paid in stablecoins.\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n***In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/8th of its treasury (or  `4,357,187` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***\n\nThe remaining 7/8ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n#### Specification\n1/8th of the DAO's existing treasury, or  `4,357,187`  MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, in equal proportions. Using the current price of MANA (4.8 USD/MANA) this transaction will generate ~`20,914,498` USD\n \nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig using DEX protocols over a period of several weeks ensuring to get an average price and minimizing the impact on markets liquidity.\n\n#### For\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n#### Against\nReject the proposed asset allocation.","choices":["For","Against","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3192,"scores_total":11096784,"votes":65,"manaVP":8384126,"landVP":2228000,"namesVP":31100,"delegatedVP":453557,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"c1aad530-525c-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmR3Dm7dEnydoLuthxpG9GE6Cfv8oCck75v1DE6Ps8NUNp","user":"0xc34bfc6519942fa1331766b0f107c2b382c4b9bc","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name loveleilei","start_at":"2021-12-01T04:11:00.132Z","finish_at":"2021-12-08T04:11:00.132Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"loveleilei","description":"perfect perfect perfect perfect","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3183,"scores_total":766005,"votes":31,"manaVP":49268,"landVP":206000,"namesVP":93700,"delegatedVP":417036,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"f1d3db10-524f-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmV9ELk5mBLspYLf7o2KMNVKyF8NRokWxMVZv4k69UYcQG","user":"0x0d021557dcc058b70beb430425d212ac1b541db6","type":"poll","title":"Age Limits Areas","start_at":"2021-12-01T02:39:00.474Z","finish_at":"2021-12-08T02:39:00.474Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Age Limits Areas","description":"Everyone knows that the younger generation now a days are very technically advanced and online.

Following the passing of the proposal, there was a duration of time before the fee change went into effect. This refund proposal would *only* affect wearables submitted during this period of 'limbo', where the changes were approved, but hadn't yet been enacted.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n*(1)* Establish a time stamp for when the approved wearable publishing fee adjustment went into public affect on the https://builder.decentraland.org/ domain\n\n*(2)* Determine which wearables were published at the original 500 MANA fee *after* the DAO approval on 10:13AM on November 7th, 2021 (snapshot below) and *before* the time stamp established from step (1)\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.dcl.eth/proposal/QmZ8DGYqLb8yVCmiN8XmnqyYu3BMw8bS23NJWQ2335PQQW\n\n*(3)* Calculate, audit, and issue credit back to affected creators for the price difference according to the newly-approved and implemented system applied to MANA prices at the original time of publication.\n\nFor example, if 2 wearables were published by Creator X on November 10th for 1,000 MANA and the price of MANA was $4 USD at that time, then the actual price per the enacted DAO proposal would be 125 MANA ( = $500 USD ) for each wearable. According to this math, Creator X should've paid only 250 MANA rather than 1,000 and would be eligible to receive a 750 MANA refund while still having paid the updated publication fee.\n\n**Purpose:** Why is this important to the Decentraland community? As an involved community member and creator myself, I understand the importance creators have on the growth of this fantastic community and social ecosystem. During this 'limbo' period, although it was no more than a week or so, many creators were dissuaded from publishing content knowing that the fees were going to be adjusted to a lower price.\n\nFor some, deadlines do not permit us to be selective about when we submit wearables for review, so for those that were negatively impacted by this short-lived situation, this would be appropriate compensation. Lastly, it should also be stated that this is a unique scenario and that few creators actually submitted during this time, so the total impact is relatively small making this a feasible proposal to take on and address.\n\nThank you kindly for your time and consideration ~","choices":["Agree to Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators","Do Not Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3177,"scores_total":5567246,"votes":47,"manaVP":2345835,"landVP":2754000,"namesVP":24700,"delegatedVP":442711,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"2a4dbc00-520e-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmUhK6276Z5DLe1HUVVtoESdPKEVJr1VvrmaWNELZdoaki","user":"0xf3f1f5cc169b39d488341d8737f085a6c6be7316","type":"poll","title":"In Decentraland, should we make name plates 25% larger and name text 25% larger and yellow for minted Decentraland Names, so that they are more visible than the non-minted names?","start_at":"2021-11-30T18:48:00.440Z","finish_at":"2021-12-07T18:48:00.440Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"In Decentraland, should we make name plates 25% larger and name text 25% larger and yellow for minted Decentraland Names, so that they are more visible than the non-minted names?","description":"For those that have minted a Decentraland Name, I believe that the name plate in Decentraland should be more visible than the non-minted names.

Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4. \n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services. \n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well.

The subreddit has almost 500k members and there have been over 100 books published covering Blender.\n\nAs a creator that's made virtual worlds and avatars across dozens of platforms (including Decentraland) I've used Blender for:\n\n- creating, fixing, and optimizing 3D models and avatars\n- converting between different 3D file formats (great glTF support)\n    - 20k meebits were made into usable avatar files using Blender\n- High quality renders, lightmapping, and animations\n- Exporting content directly to web based virual worlds\n\nFeatures include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.\n\nOne of the foundation's goals is \"to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core\".\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation\n\nBlender is GPL licensed, ensuring that the code will be free as a public good for all time. It protects the developer and user community from malicious patents, hostile forks, lock-down attempts, bait-and-switch-to-closed. Other software that is GPL licensed include the Linux kernel and wordpress. [Learn more](https://www.blender.org/about/license/)\n\nIt'll be iconic for Decentraland to be the first crypto-native project to be a sponsor and have its logo displayed here next to tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Unity, Epic, Nvidia, Steam, Microsoft, etc: https://i.imgur.com/oK3sIrw.png\n\nCosts for corporate gold (based on 11/3 MANA price of $2.88):\n\n~12,100 MANA per year\n~60.5k MANA for 5 years\n\nIt's ~ <1% of the MANA released (https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac), a small cost to send a large industry message about where we stand on software freedom and the open metaverse. I think it's a smart PR move, like how Visa bought a Cryptopunk.\n\nBlender currently employs 26 full time employees, and 12 freelancers remotely. Unity has over 5000. We need more open source in gaming.\n\nLink: https://fund.blender.org/","specification":"This is a one time donation to Blender fund which in return will get the Decentraland Logo next to the likes of Google, Steam, Adobe, Microsoft, Activision, etc. I'll continue to advocate for public goods funding across the twittersphere to help ensure an open metaverse ecosystem thrives over the next decade.","personnel":"Blender Foundation info:\n\n- https://fund.blender.org/about/\n- https://www.blender.org/about/people/\n- https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/","roadmap":"Blender Foundation will actively reach out to Corporate members to discuss the bi-annual planning for grants and review past supported projects.\n\nhttps://fund.blender.org/corporate-memberships/","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":2704,"scores_total":3438622,"votes":66,"manaVP":436280,"landVP":2696000,"namesVP":31300,"delegatedVP":275041,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"bceacf90-3c78-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmeVN3gwzmzmmTDtJ4n2vsLBSa9yHyricpuH2gjhLC7f9K","user":"0xa2926eab4283efe2ee2455cad92a0037d078ecb4","type":"poll","title":"Android","start_at":"2021-11-03T07:36:00.490Z","finish_at":"2021-11-10T07:36:00.490Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Android","description":"Decentraland for android/iOS?","choices":["YES","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2693,"scores_total":656447,"votes":17,"manaVP":40600,"landVP":140000,"namesVP":7400,"delegatedVP":468446,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"56295c90-3c0f-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmTobC3njNHP77nqswTwhUhDaRwm391RBixP7ArQWppcFi","user":"0x19e167ae860d92f6d1e4c723c732238f62ae4f82","type":"poll","title":"Allow players to disable the \"VIEW PROFILE\" button when looking at another player","start_at":"2021-11-02T19:01:00.938Z","finish_at":"2021-11-09T19:01:00.938Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"finished","configuration":{"title":"Allow players to disable the \"VIEW PROFILE\" button when looking at another player","description":"As Decentraland gets more crowded, often times people walk in front of each other.

However with MANA currently over $2 USD, paying 500 MANA upfront to submit a design is not possible for many creators.\n\nBy maintaining the 500 MANA fee the Wearables Editor becomes available only to established creators and others with deep pockets and excludes young and newer creators who cannot afford $1000 USD or more to submit a wearable.  \n\n**Limitations**\nHaving the wearable publication fee tied directly to fiat value would be complicated as value can change by a few pennies on any given day. Not only would this create a need for fractional MANA transactions, but it could have the unintended consequence of creators waiting for some ideal price to submit their designs.\n\n**The solution is to have a fee with a set value that is adjusted weekly.**\nAt a set time once per week, the wearable publication fee would be set based on the current USD fiat value of the token, so that the fee is approximately $500 USD rounded to the nearest whole MANA.\n\nThis would eliminate the need for fractional MANA transactions and would keep the value of the fee relatively constant. Any dramatic change in value is corrected by the next week, allowing the fee to remain relatively constant regardless of changes in the value of MANA.\n\n**Proposal**\nThis serves as a proposal to once weekly adjust the wearable publication fee so that the fiat value is approximately equivalent to $500 USD, rounded to the nearest whole MANA instead of a flat MANA fee. The Curation Committee‚Äôs compensation would be proportionally adjusted to remain at 10% of the fee.","choices":["Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee on a Weekly Basis to Reflect an Approximate Fiat Value","Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee at a Different Frequency to reflect an Approximate Fiat Value","Leave the Wearable Publication Fee at 500 MANA","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2652,"scores_total":2741905,"votes":52,"manaVP":469470,"landVP":1306000,"namesVP":28600,"delegatedVP":937835,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"a3d8a710-3a67-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmZqngt1jBSYQ8NX8eabWAP5t1NiZcDJaFMfi56CDcSmjf","user":"0x739eb7914cd124d049d999c6f1874914af4f5337","type":"poll","title":"Should we have a way to automatically adjust prices based on exchange rate?","start_at":"2021-10-31T16:28:00.657Z","finish_at":"2021-11-07T16:28:00.657Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"finished","configuration":{"title":"Should we have a way to automatically adjust prices based on exchange rate?","description":"With the recent spike in the exchange rate of MANA many reasonably priced items are now absurd.

Let's change the protocol and open new doors.","description":"Hello, everyone. Today I want to talk about a thing that is stopping the progress of Decentraland events. This thing is latency on streams.\n\nWhat I mean is that every time someone tries to stream inside a screen there are many seconds between the real world and what the screen shows. Inside DCL, it's usually about 20seconds or more depending on the server and where is the player located.\n\nI have seen that this thing makes events less enjoyable. For example, if there is a streamer and you talk in the chat of DCL, you need to wait a lot until that person responds/interacts with you.\n\nIn this sense, events that depend on streaming are very slow. Most of the players will end up following the stream via Twitch or YouTube (if the event manager is also streaming there) and it kills the experience.\n\nRight now, I want to make new events with cool ideas but those events depend on streaming and it's quite impossible to do it with 20+ seconds of delay (most of the time is 40seconds).\n\nI think this problem exists because of HLS which is the protocol Decentraland uses. From what I have seen, it is good in terms of compatibility but latency sucks. There are other options available such as WebRTC, RTMP and more. I don't know what could work with DCL but I think we need to change this. Streaming is very important and streams make events better and open new doors.\n\nPlease open the forum post that references this proposal so we all have a nice and polite discussion.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S: with better latency, we could make epic streams with games, karaokes and a bunch of stuff!

Web3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects like [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/), there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.\n\nThe following solution would require third-parties (i.e. original creators of an NFT project) to apply to the DAO to be ‚Äúregistered‚Äù within Decentraland. Approved third parties would be added to a Third Party Registry (TPR): a smart contract deployed to Polygon.\n\nThird-parties would then be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs in Decentraland. Items should still be vetted by the Wearables Curtation Committee. All approved items would then be logged in the TPR with a unique identifier (URN).\n\nThis solution requires some work from the third parties. Each would have to build a ‚Äúresolver‚Äù mapping their NFTs to the corresponding items in the TPR. This resolver would need to expose a standardized API endpoint that a Decentraland client could call whenever a player opens their backpack.\n\nThe mapping between NFTs and item URNs is up to the third party. For example, since the resolver is built by the third party, the response to the Decentraland client could be customized to return one URN for an NFT, or one URN for multiple NFTs. \n\n**These third-party representations of \"source\" NFTs would be different from current Decentraland wearables:**\n\n* The publication fees should vary depending on the size of the collection.\n* It would be impossible for these representations to be exchanged (in either a primary or secondary sale) in _any_ marketplace _independently_ from the source NFT. These new items are only 3D representations of the source NFT, and do not have their own corresponding token that can be traded.\n\n**Specification**\n\nFirst, some quick definitions:\n\n**Third Party**\n\nThe original creator of the external NFT.\n\n**Source NFT**\n\nA specific NFT within a collection of external NFTs made by a third party. For example: CryptoKitties, Apes from BAYC, etc.\n\n**Item**\n\nThe asset, or in-world representation, for a source NFT. These are identified in the TPR by a unique identifier (URN).\n\n**Collection**\n\nA collection of items that all belong to the same theme of NFTs. (e.g. apes from BAYC) \n\n**Item Slot**\n\nOne of a limited number of potential representations that Third Parties may use. Item slots are bought in tiers for MANA. \n\n**Third Party Registry (TPR)**\n\nThe smart contract deployed to Polygon that stores the list of approved third parties and the items that represent their NFTs.\n\n**Third Party Resolver**\n\nAn API built by a third party that allows clients to verify which source NFTs are owned by the player and which item representations correspond with those NFTs that can be rendered in-world. \n\n**Process overview**\n\n**Application phase**\n\nThird-party NFT projects propose the addition of a collection to the Decentraland DAO. These DAO proposals should have their own category within the governance dApp, and they should have a minimum threshold of 1M VP voting in favor (similar to grants) needed to pass.\n\n**A voting period**\n\nDAO members should be able to vote on whether or not to include the new third-party collection. The voting period should last 1 week, like other proposal categories.\n\n**Collection registration**\n\nApproved collections are added to the TPR deployed to Polygon. This is done by the DAO Committee.\n\n**Collection management**\n\nAfter a collection is approved by the DAO and registered in the TPR, the third-party may add, edit, and manage items within the collection. All of this management will be done via a new UI exposed in the Builder available to approved third parties.\n\n**Purchasing item slots**\n\nPart of the collection management stage is the process of buying item slots for a collection. These slots can be purchased in batches in exchange for MANA.\n\nThe size of the batches and price function should be determined in a separate proposal.\n\n**Item approval**\n\nLike all wearables, items must be reviewed and approved by the Wearables Curation Committee. Items must be ‚Äúlocked‚Äù by the third-party before they can be approved by the curation committee. As collections of third party NFTs might include thousands of items, members of the curators committee should be permitted to sample specific items before approving items in batches. It would be unrealistic to review items individually.\n\n**Item registration**\n\nAll items are uploaded and edited by third party managers (addresses given ‚Äúmanager‚Äù permissions in the Builder) before they are added to the TPR. Items added to the TPR are then reviewed by the Wearables Curation Committee. \n\n**Deployment**\n\nWearable models and textures are uploaded to the catalyst network after ensuring each URN has been added to the TPR. This results in an address check either via a subgraph or a check to the TPR contract itself.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThird parties are responsible for developing their own API endpoint mapping their NFTs to the item URNs in the TPR. This endpoint‚Äôs shape should follow a predefined standard to avoid one-off integrations. Furthermore, the logic behind this endpoint and any interaction with other smart contracts would be outside the scope of Decentraland‚Äôs involvement. Full legal responsibility lies with the third party to ensure that they only interact with smart contracts whose IP they‚Äôre permitted to use.\n\n**For a visual overview of the collection creation, approval, deployment, and resolution flow [see this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znwxC35wg6kzksvqP3pCMiJ2D-DwgtF3/view?usp=sharing).**\n\n**Additional comments**\n\n* While this implementation could support any form of asset, the first use-case is wearables for avatars based on PFP NFTs.\n* The goal isn‚Äôt to make external NFTs compatible with Decentraland, but to create new representations within Decentraland that are linked with external NFTs.\n* The Curation Committee is responsible only for approving _items_ submitted by third parties. The DAO would approve the addition of new third parties.\n* The Curation Committee always has the ability to reject specific items, all items within a collection, and all items from a Third Party creator should the resolver provide incorrect data, or no data at all, to the client\n* Items won‚Äôt exist inside traditional wearable collections, won‚Äôt have rarity, and cannot be sold in primary or secondary sales. They are only in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the TPR.\n\n**Should the suggested implementation for wearable representations of third party NFTs be developed by the Foundation?**","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2392,"scores_total":2835909,"votes":121,"manaVP":85193,"landVP":2102000,"namesVP":78800,"delegatedVP":569915,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"5d2ae1f0-2b8c-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmV7C32KWtSCDAk4p5m6BYey2yWfxz6thG2hwakNYwrTzH","user":"0xedce8440c3665a0affbf2e686d32a8d02ff361e4","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 88,-14 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-10-12T18:44:00.015Z","finish_at":"2021-10-19T18:44:00.015Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":88,"y":-14,"description":"Penguinclub is a community project where multiple people spent a lot of time in organisation and building over last few weeks already.

We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let‚Äôs create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it‚Äôs just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won‚Äôt be just a  ‚Äòtour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.\nI fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I‚Äôd love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.","specification":"Hire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.\nHire Website Designer, Videographer\nEducate introductory tour guides\nAny left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!","personnel":"Astrid Pilla, Here's my LinkedIn Profile! https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridpilla/\nAnd my website about page:  https://www.nftcreatortours.com/about\nI‚Äôve conducted docent tours around the Metaverse during DCL 100xArt Week, have volunteered with NFTs.tip s both on the Admin side and as a Clubhouse Room moderator, a writing contributor to NFTS.WTF, helped with several drops and am currently helping about 8 high profile NFT projects as we speak. I have toured high profile clients (musicians, BBoys, NYPL, movie production designers) throughout DCL.  I have helped organize high profile speaker panels combining a clubhouse room, twitter space, screen share on Discord or zoom depending on clients location showing walk-though in DCL as well.   Beginner education including how to set up a Metamask and safety/security.  My favorite thing to do in my free time right now is to attend any DCL event where @category5music is playing!\nI have an intimate understanding of the wants and needs of fashion creators after having worked in the modeling industry in Paris on the business/accounting side.  And after a stint working on a team in support of the luxury group Kering and later co-creating a luxury medical practice, I understand deeply what is required to succeed in these high-end industries, AND the mindset of businesses in Europe. Plus let‚Äôs face it- DCL is a tour de force of a Metaverse!  I look forward to creating relationships with those I haven‚Äôt met already in DCL!","roadmap":"In Phase I,  provide introductory tours and fully onboard 3-4 either creators/brands/celebrities.

That is our goal between now and March 2022. \n\nIn Phase 2: Outreach to schools in the creative arts (think Parsons School of Design) and help with introducing them to the space, providing an eventual Student Mentorship program (Phase 2 by end of May 2022)\n \nPhase 3:  If I can find a space to host us,  or if we end up being able to buy a space in DCL to create this:  A ‚Äúgift shop‚Äù type of experience after our very first tour!  Featuring wearables and art we found along our tour.  (Think: high quality Museum gift shop like theMOMA). \n\n** LATE PHASE POSSIBILITY: Conferences and/or Events planned for the benefit of our artist/technical community and a DCL Kid Creator Fashion Show of all the wearables that came into the space during this time plus our Kid Collabs!!

Since then 12 grants have been given for Content Creator, Platform Contributor, Gaming and Community categories.\n\nThe current structure is aimed to single individuals:\n* Tier 1: One-time payment of $500 - $1500 USD in MANA\n* Tier 2: One-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA\n* Tier 3: Up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff.\n\nThis proposal aims to create 3 new tires designed for teams and larger scoped projects.\n\n### Motivation\nThe current tires are good to fit small projects and individual contributions. If more money is needed the contributor can continue requesting further grants to keep up the good work (eg. KevinOnEarth).\n\nIn order to tackle bigger projects that require the commitment of a team for many months we need to scale our tire options. This will attract more talent to the ecosystem.\n\n### Specification\nThe proposed new tires are:\n* Tire 4: Up to $60.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n* Tire 5: Up to $120.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n* Tire 6: Up to $240.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n\nThese tires allow a team to receive up to 10k, 20k or 40k per month for over 6 months. The amounts represent the maximum requested value per tire and it opens the possibility to request less money, for example with Tire 4 one could ask for 3k USD per month over 6 months.\n\nIt‚Äôs recommended to teams to start with small tires, get idea‚Äôs validation from the community, show some progress and later request a bigger grant to suit the escalation of operations. It will be quite harder to get DAO approval for a massive grant to an unknown team.\n\nTeams should report progress to the DAO Facilitator which will be included in regular reports. The grants are provided via revocable vesting contracts, thus enabling the DAO to cut a program that doesn‚Äôt deliver what was promised.\n\n### Benefits\nThere are many ways the DAO benefits from the success of grants:\n\nFirst, if these grants add value to Decentraland‚Äôs ecosystem then MANA should get more general awareness and the price should go up, thus making the treasury of the DAO bigger. So what is good for Decentraland is good for the DAO.\n\nSecond, I would love to see projects capable of generating a revenue stream, becoming profitable ventures, and generating employment around Decentraland. Enabling more people to make a living out of Decentraland‚Äôs ecosystem is key.\n\nUltimately, bringing new people on board with skills and mindsets it‚Äôs a great benefit for the DAO.

Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client‚Äôs open source code base, but given the DAO‚Äôs ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months. The Foundation would provide a roadmap to the DAO to review, provide feedback on, and approve on the same 6 month schedule to help communicate to the community the Foundation‚Äôs strategic and technical priorities.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n* Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n* Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n* Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n* Improve the quality and performance of the client‚Äôs graphics\n* Improve the client‚Äôs ability to support more concurrent users\n\n### Background\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it‚Äôs impact the broader platform, it‚Äôs important to define some terms:\n\n**The ‚ÄúDAO‚Äù**\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of the platform‚Äôs policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland‚Äôs digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland‚Äôs codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**The ‚ÄúDecentraland Foundation‚Äù**\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community. \n\n**The ‚ÄúDecentraland Stack‚Äù**\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex ‚Äústack‚Äù of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the _Decentraland Platform_. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as: \n\n1. The **smart contracts** that make possible Decentraland‚Äôs scarce digital assets (like land, estates, wearables, names, etc.)\n2. The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3. The **software development kit** that people use to build content for the world.\n4. **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for the world without writing code.\n5. **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland‚Äôs digital assets.\n6. **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself.\n\n**The ‚ÄúReference Client‚Äù**\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is a web based app that allows people to access and interact with content and other people within Decentraland‚Äôs virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt‚Äôs helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can‚Äôt dictate changes to any other components of the platform - those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Duration and renewal of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule.\n\nThe Foundation would be responsible for writing each 6 month iteration of the roadmap, but each iteration must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**Ideation and validation for the roadmap**\n\nThe DAO must have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n**Deviations from the roadmap**\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation‚Äôs familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland‚Äôs user base, and regulatory requirements, but these departures must be later approved by the DAO as part of the biannual schedule.\n\n**Funding development**\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n**Termination of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n**Limits of the delegation**\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform (e.g. changes to the Marketplace‚Äôs smart contracts); any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued  development of the platform.\n2. The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n3. Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n4. So, it‚Äôs clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, _at least some level of formal delegation_ is needed\n5. The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community\n6. The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO","choices":["For","Against","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2302,"scores_total":11007013,"votes":133,"manaVP":6676274,"landVP":3828000,"namesVP":12200,"delegatedVP":490538,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"70917af0-2570-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmbrdH7UZECgMwmGcstLBtP8TSkVJVBimZKzp73BYFHfDu","user":"0xcf10cd8b5dc2323b1eb6de6164647756bad4de4d","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 47,-45 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-10-05T00:08:00.679Z","finish_at":"2021-10-12T00:08:00.679Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":47,"y":-45,"description":"Golfcraft is a play2earn game native to Decentraland made by PabloEst & Eibriel.\n\nFind more information about it on Twitter: https://twitter.com/golfcraftGame\n\nVideo teaser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2REgy3hCoM","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":2300,"scores_total":820081,"votes":138,"manaVP":217122,"landVP":240000,"namesVP":25300,"delegatedVP":337658,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"e9c33b70-22af-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmU2VkBpDqKLUKikurKJS8uBQERYyKprsiMs9H1T3WXDPX","user":"0xded1fd193cd8b55c2f9c42b3257d5a9088c7d137","type":"poll","title":"Need an approval for hair wearable","start_at":"2021-10-01T12:05:00.816Z","finish_at":"2021-10-08T12:05:00.816Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Need an approval for hair wearable","description":"Hello,\n\nI made this hair wearable and used the name ‚ÄúGoku‚Äù.

This has been mentioned  [in the docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/the-dao-fund/)  and  [in the blog](https://decentraland.org/blog/platform/community-funding/)  before, but many may not be aware of it.\n\nThe DAO has a lot of resources and a thriving community but lacks executing power. We need to invest more money and time in building infrastructure for Decentraland‚Äôs DAO.\n\nAt the moment the DAO has 4 teams:\n* Security Advisory Board: 5 people to address security risk.\n* DAO Committee: 3 people to enact proposals on-chain.\n* DAO Facilitator: 1 person to produce reports and organize meets.\n* Wearable Curation Committee: 3 people to review applications.\n\n\nThis proposal aims to create a new team with the mission of developing new software.\n\n### Motivation\nAt the moment the DAO is supporting contributions in the form of grants aimed to individual contributors. As an open-source project we rely on external contributors, being The Foundation the most active contributor.\n\nThe Foundation team has ~45 people working under their wing, they have been doing an amazing job and brought us a great decentralized platform and a world explorer to enjoy it.\n\nBut in order to accomplish the wider goal of becoming a more capable and powerful DAO, we need to take action. We need to onboard new contributors to help build Decentraland‚Äôs ecosystem. We need to create our own teams capable of executing the vision of the DAO.\n\nWe can start by speeding the development of our Governance dApp. This app is a critical piece of software for the DAO and it needs to be well maintained. It's also a small project in terms of scope, which makes it a great place to start.\n\n### Specification\nA team of highly capable full-time contributors will be assembled, filling the primary roles of Team Lead, Product Manager, Technical Writer, Web Designer, Solidity and, frontend dev.\n\nThe main scope of this team will be:\n* Become core maintainers of the Governance dApp.\n* Automate key processes of DAO‚Äôs operations.\n* Research proposals in order to enrich conversations.\n* Build new dApps to support community use-cases.\n\nThe DAO will set a budget and formally delegate the Governance dApp to the team. The team will be free to work on ideas that make the conversation in the governance more fruitful. The team will report their progress and consult their roadmap with the community.\n\nThis team won‚Äôt be focusing on contributing to projects already maintained by The Foundation (eg. client, builder, marketplace). If they do, they will be treated by the maintainers as regular open-source contributions.\n\nA list of things to work on the Governance dApp at the moment:\n* Automate generation of reports.\n* Replace Aragon's UI to ease DAO Committee operations.\n* Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.\n* Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.\n* Add a Members' page listing current teams and members.\n* Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.\n* Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.\n* Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.\n* Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.\n* Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.\n* Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process\n\nFunding a team to work primarily on the Governance dApp will produce faster development than relying on individual contributions because of their capability of shipping cross-cutting features. \n\nThis is a push to boost Decentraland‚Äôs ecosystem. We‚Äôll start with one piece by building a team to improve it. If this strategy proves successful we could build more scoped teams to maintain and build other projects.\n\nThe point of this proposal is to reach a consensus that the DAO should begin the process of forming its own dApps team. The details of how many members, what their roles are, how much they are paid and how often, and how the DAO can oversee their work should be covered in a separate proposal(s).\n\n### Vote\n* **For**: Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n* **Against**: Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","choices":["Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2150,"scores_total":816079,"votes":20,"manaVP":97443,"landVP":266000,"namesVP":10400,"delegatedVP":442236,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmNeyrR9dqMkdgL4PexpLNp1LiqNX252ZgdFfQX3YRuNCg","user":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","type":"poll","title":"Reimburse gas fees to DAO Committee Members","start_at":"2021-09-17T21:41:00.844Z","finish_at":"2021-09-24T21:41:00.844Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Reimburse gas fees to DAO Committee Members","description":"### Summary\nReimburse gas fees spent by DAO Committee Members when enacting transactions for the DAO.\n\n### Abstract\nThe DAO Committee is responsible for sending on-chain transactions in order to update Decentraland‚Äôs Smart Contracts.\n\nEverytime a votation about Catalyst, POI, Ban and Grants passes, we send two transactions to the Aragon‚Äôs DAO contract in order to enact the proposal. The first transaction creates the action on the DAO and we have to wait 24 hours before we can send a second transaction to execute it. This delay period was included for security, during that time the action can be paused by any DAO committee or SAB member.\n\nThese two transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. The fee is extracted from the wallet sending the transaction, the DAO Committee Member‚Äôs wallet.\n\nThere are other cases in which the members of the DAO Committee also spend gas, for example deploying vesting contracts and transferring the ownership of them to the DAO. Some polls may also require the Committee to take on-chain action which incurs in gas fees.\n\nThe addresses of the DAO Committee are:\n\n* 0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc (Yemel)\n* 0xBef99f5f55CF7cDb3a70998C57061B7e1386a9b0 (HPrivakos)\n* 0x3323B7264F7D5e8f98e6aFCcec73b6bA1116AE19 (Eric)\n\n\n### Motivation\nI‚Äôm the one who has sent more transactions in the group.

When you claim (mint) a name it is displayed as yourname.dcl.eth However it is also possible to further claim (mint) names from yourname by using the https://app.ens.domains/ app\n\nAs a test I have successfully minted surprise name from kinder DCL name. This name now reads surprise.kinder. You can see it from this link below\n\nhttps://app.ens.domains/name/surprise.kinder 3\n\nRight now this name is a token only. For it to become an ERC721 NFT a new smart contract will need to written.

Decentraland Metaverse is an excellent place for brand recognition, awareness, adoption, marketing, advertising. It even works for individuals and small teams.\n\nSlowly we are seeing the formations of guilds, groups, teams, friends, families, fans and much more. The idea behind this new proposal is only the make things more fun, exciting while adding another utility to names.\n\nEach event is just getting bigger and better with more players coming in. The most recent CocaCola event was totally epic. So I thought to my self wouldn‚Äôt it be fun if the CocaCola team members all had names? for example imagine they are named diet.cocacola, zerosugar.cocacola, vanilla.cocacola and so on. Straight away you would know who the official representatives are because of their name. Many other example can be given. However it does not have to be a company or a business‚Äôs. It can be fan based groups. Let‚Äôs say a group of females are super into Bratz and they can have the names meygan.bratz, yasmin.bratz and cloe.bratz.\n\nSubdomains can be minted directly from ens domain website. Although all the names are NFT‚Äôs the subdomains on the other hand are only tokens. For the subdomains to become NFT‚Äôs a new smart-contract has to be created.\n\nThis will allow all subdomains to be easily used, transferred, traded just like any other NFT\n\nMain usage for dcl subdomains\n\n- Guilds, Groups\n- Friends, Families\n- Businesses, Brands\n- Platforms, Projects\n- Games, Events\n- Giveaways, Prizes\n\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/create-a-new-smart-contract-for-decentraland-names-subdomain-s-to-be-nft-s/1850\n\n\nPlease vote \"YES\" or \"NO\"","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2083,"scores_total":3160367,"votes":42,"manaVP":303977,"landVP":2114000,"namesVP":300200,"delegatedVP":442189,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"9485f870-114b-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmaG188qwu7FwneATFPH4PEKSUky43WK4zc3ETJ6RUY56V","user":"0xfce9b76ae84c176b51988219f1e822c241706640","type":"poll","title":"should there be an option to save favourite locations?","start_at":"2021-09-09T08:54:00.368Z","finish_at":"2021-09-16T08:54:00.368Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"should there be an option to save favourite locations?","description":"I think we all need this one...","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2069,"scores_total":837185,"votes":30,"manaVP":199893,"landVP":452000,"namesVP":58100,"delegatedVP":127192,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"35e10620-1015-11ec-853d-5ff6f49b5cff","snapshot_id":"QmQDThG3LhCWCdWH4LSUAvKV5mgXzr2t3v2L1hrv4RQZQo","user":"0x5a659a97dfbd423a8824d472c879135b7e6c2227","type":"poll","title":"Enhance flexibility for wearables creators in collections","start_at":"2021-09-07T19:53:00.595Z","finish_at":"2021-09-14T19:53:00.595Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Enhance flexibility for wearables creators in collections","description":"As it stands today, wearables creators must publish the entirety of their collection at once. There is no ability to add to it after it's originally been published.  For any creator trying to bring new items to market on a regular rhythm - versus all at once at the beginning - this leads to a bad consumer experience, as the newer wearables must be created, approved and published in a new collection with a different name. \n\nCreators should have the ability to flow newness into their existing collection over the course of a year, thus creating excitement with avatars/players and a reason to revisit a shop/marketplace.  Imagine:  sneaker drops from your favorite creator 4x/year or apparel creators launching t-shirts and jackets on a seasonal basis,  all under a single, easy to shop collection taxonomy.  In other metaverses, the artist has the ability to do this.    \n\nThis proposal specifically is to enable artists to manage their collection by adding items over time instead of the collection being locked in upon the initial mints.  To be clear, the proposal calls for the same DAO item-level approval as happens now.  This is decidedly NOT a proposal asking the DAO to grant approval on the first items and then carte blanche ability for the artist to do whatever they want in the later ones.   The DAO will still maintain approval at the item level, and artists will revert back to the DAO when ready to extend their lines of product.  This change would simply allow artists to choose whether to publish in a separate collection or to add to their existing, likely master, collection.\n\nUltimately, it is DCL players that benefit as they will be able to more clearly track newness and shop from artist collections they prefer.  Plus, the marketplace browsing will be less cluttered.   As it stands today, many artists have multiple collections - upwards of 10 - and to scroll through these takes time for the shopper.  Allowing an option of a single master collection will streamline browsing and buying for DCL consumers.","choices":["Allow wearables creators to add new items to existing collections, assuming DAO item approval","Do not allow any new items to be added to existing collections, even if DAO has approved the item","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2057,"scores_total":942358,"votes":26,"manaVP":347868,"landVP":136000,"namesVP":16300,"delegatedVP":442189,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"84a87790-0e92-11ec-a5a8-05cb7ba30f57","snapshot_id":"QmTVLN8Q2ANAabyFoHU3i2SBZS3D3eZTGS4P345ysLCw2o","user":"0xeaff5dce42db9cc5fa6efe2e6bd926b8017386fc","type":"poll","title":"Inverting the y-axis of the mouse","start_at":"2021-09-05T21:44:00.530Z","finish_at":"2021-09-12T21:44:00.530Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Inverting the y-axis of the mouse","description":"Various amounts of games allow the y-axis of the mouse to be inverted in the settings.

These tasks ensure governance remains accessible to anyone who has a good idea and easy to participate in for anyone with a good opinion.\n\n### Objectives\n- Increase participation within the Decentraland DAO\n- Liaise between the DAO Committee and the community\n- Increase the amount and quality of community discourse\n- Help facilitate productive conversations and field questions related to the DAO\n\n### The candidate\nAfter the [open call for candidates](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-facilitator-job-call-for-nominees/1911/2), phergyson nominated Matimio on the forum, who then accepted the nomination. I had a conversation w/ Matimio and I believe he would make a fantastic DAO Facilitator.\n\n\"I am a PhD Candidate in Future Studies and Political Science, researching democratic futures, future governance models and the ‚Äúbiopolitical‚Äù significance of sanctuary, for example, sanctuary cities or the practice of seeking refuge in a protected space from the sovereign power/law of the state - something that may have increasing relevance in metaverse and blockchain spaces. In the Mevaterse space, I am:\n\n- An active member of the Decentraland community and member of the Lastslice Collective.\n- Building ‚ÄúThe DCLSanctuary‚Äù, which is a POI and premised in part on my PhD Dissertation and aims to be an intellectual center of gravity for metaverse research, analysis and public policy.\n- Moderator for Deadheads NFT, primarily brought on to consult on issues of governance\n- Moderator for The Alien Boy NFT, also brought on to help with community management and governance\n- Project Manager for Cardano NFT Project: The Ronin Universe\n- I am already actively monitoring and participating in the DCL and other DAOs in the Metaverse and NFT space, and the combination of my academic/professional expertise and digital community facilitation/management experience, I believe, makes me an ideal fit for this position.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to work with and for the DCL Community, and appreciate you considering me for this position.\n\n-Matimio (aka: Mat)\"\n\nYou can read Matimio's post history on the forum [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/matimio/summary) or search for him on Discord, Matimio#4673.\n\n### DAO Facilitator Responsibilities\n- Compose and publish the Decentraland DAO Committee reports (include attending DAO Committee meetings and taking notes).\n- Compose and publish the DAO Community Grants updates. Summarize grantee activity regularly and expose grant project progress to the community. Flag grant recipients that have not made satisfactory progress.\n- Organize, schedule, and administrate community member meetups in the DAO hub\nTo discuss current proposals, issues, and questions related to the DAO\nTo be held as often as needed but at least once a month and accommodating various time zones.\n- Share strategic feedback with the Decentraland Foundation Governance team regarding community engagement and user needs within the DAO.\n- Schedule and organize community roundtable discussions for noteworthy issues\n-- To be held as needed\n-- Take notes and summarize for community\n\n### Compensation\nUp to 15 hours/week\n2000 MANA/month, paid monthly\n\nOver the last summer I have acted as a sort of proto-facilitator and begun setting up the infrastructure for a Facilitator to succeed (DAO hub, publishing schedules, stakeholders) and talked to many community members and Foundation team members to find the most valuable activities for this role. However, the responsibilities of a Facilitator should evolve to adapt to the community‚Äôs needs over time.

Use includes deployments, transfers, marketplace listings (including unfulfilled), and the owner of the account signing into the marketplace.\n\n\n* **Lost Assets**: LAND and/or ESTATES held by an account where the associated private key has been lost. Does not include LAND or ESTATES transferred to an account through accident or theft, or LAND that has been abandoned.\n\n\n* **Claimant**: a user with claim to Lost Assets.\n\n### Abstract\n\nA user who has lost access to a private key and therefore to all LAND and ESTATES held by their account must have a way to present her case to the DAO in order to regain control of her Lost Assets. The DAO can not use this procedure to reclaim abandoned LAND. The DAO can only use this procedure to recover Lost Assets owned by a user who has lost their account‚Äôs private key.\n\nThe claimant needs to present evidence beyond reasonable doubt about the incident to prove herself the rightful owner of the lost account. The case will be published on the forum and will be reviewed by a Judicial Committee to ensure it complies with _the requirements (see below)_.\n\nIf the case is approved by the committee, the claimant will be granted permission to **deploy new content** on the Lost Assets owned by the lost account but **won‚Äôt be able to transfer the LAND and ESTATES for a period of time (12 months)**.\n\nDuring that period of time, the lost account and the DAO will retain the power to revoke deployment permissions of the claimant. After that year the claimant will be able to transfer their assets freely.\n\n### Motivation\n\nPrivate keys will be lost and some users will fail in their efforts to protect their assets. In case of loss, if enough proof is presented to the DAO the rightful owner should regain access to her LAND and ESTATES tokens. See [Ethen‚Äôs case](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/vote-yes-to-return-lost-land-and-set-the-precedent-for-this-moving-forward/296) as the first example.\n\nToday it is technically possible to make a secure setup to overcome the loss of a key. For example by granting co-ownership to a second account or a multisig shared with friends. \n\nHowever, given the current undeveloped state of the user experience for Ethereum, Web 3.0, and cryptocurrency in general with regards to advanced key management schemes, this kind of setup requires high technical knowledge from users.\n\nThis proposal aims to help those who fall into misfortune by providing a last hope, a journey to recover a lost account.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe ERC721 standard defines the concept of approvedForAll; ‚Äã‚Äãan owner-wide role that can transfer any ERC721 of the owner, and also set UpdateManager roles. [See roles recap](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/a-recap-land-ownership-deployment-permissions/12).\n\nThis proposal requires updating the LAND and ESTATE smart contracts to add a mechanism that allows the DAO to set the co-owner of a lost account.\n\nThe update will be a new method on the registry that allows the DAO to set the approvedForAll role to an arbitrary address.\n\nThe new co-owner will be a smart contract that will function as an escrow of the assets first giving the claimant permission to update land and estates and after twelve months the claimant will be able to transfer the assets.\n\nDuring a period of twelve months, the lost address and the DAO will keep the power to revoke the contract, an action that will return the LANDs and ESTATEs to the original owner.\n\nThe proposed changes to the LAND and ESTATE Registry are [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/pull/152/files). The intermediary contract is still pending and an external audit is still required.\n\n\n### Application Requirements\n\nTo kick off this process the user needs to present her case publicly on the forum including all evidence possible. The case will be reviewed by the Judicial Committee.\nFollowing a proposed guideline of requirements:\n\n* The ‚Äúlost‚Äù address must have a minimum of six months of inactivity.\n    * Specifically, no executed transactions by this wallet, either signing or sending txs.\n    * If the claimant has received anything inadvertently, this is not an indication that they have access to this wallet (air drops, scam coins, etc. )\n* The user provides a description of how the key was lost.\n* Objective proof of ownership, some examples are:\n    * Private messages signed with the ‚Äúlost‚Äù key.\n    * LAND description linking to claimant‚Äôs personal info.\n* Two witnesses testify on behalf of the user (over video).\n    * Character witness: Familiar with claimant‚Äôs cripto-goins (friend, work colleague).\n    * Expert witness: Developer or Community Member with technical experience.\n\nUltimately it will be the Judicial Committee's decision to approve or reject the application. In case of doubt (by any member) the application will be rejected.\n\n### Judicial Committee\n\nThe three recommended committee members proposed alongside this new implementation are:\n\n* Carl Fravel - Technology Executive, Member of many DCL districts.\n* Peter Derrick - DCL ‚ÄúBartertown‚Äù estate owner and long-time contributor.\n* Yemel Jardi - Software Engineer and early contributor to DCL.\n\nIt is suggested and proposed that these committee members remain active for an initial period of 6 months before opening a poll to replace or renew them.\n\n### Main Concerns\n\n**Can the DAO reclaim abandoned LAND?**\n\nNo, this proposal does not address the issue of abandoned land, this is for future consideration.\n\n**Is this too much power to the DAO?**\n\nThe process needs to be started by the claimant and the decision is made by the Judicial Committee. The DAO should not use this method for other cases without a formal community vote.\n\n**How can the DAO prevent fraud?**\n\nThe address must be inactive for a period of six months and in case of approval, the claimant won‚Äôt be able to sell the land for a period of a year, giving time to the presumed ‚Äúlost key‚Äù to appear and stop this process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n* Form the Committee but don‚Äôt upgrade the contracts. Give the DAO a budget to buy land and return it to the claimant.\n\n* Upgrade the contracts but don‚Äôt form the Committee, just let the DAO to judge case by case.\n\n* Do nothing to help users that lost keys and handle the land as if were abandoned.\n\n### Vote\n**For**: Upgrade Decentraland‚Äôs smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Against**: Do not upgrade Decentraland‚Äôs smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Other**: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal and publish a revised version.","choices":["For: Upgrade Decentraland‚Äôs smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets","Against: Do not upgrade Decentraland‚Äôs smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets","Other: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal."]},"discourse_topic_id":1921,"scores_total":4545689,"votes":42,"manaVP":571269,"landVP":3390000,"namesVP":41500,"delegatedVP":542920,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"f97ebc10-0450-11ec-bf2e-8bc0e796957b","snapshot_id":"QmUTQNfA9fNC9CLFAZuH11e9rrJzgS2CZyHEkRZ3NPe6Ai","user":"0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406","type":"grant","title":"Continue Video Editor for The Decentraland Report","start_at":"2021-08-23T20:30:00.138Z","finish_at":"2021-08-30T20:30:00.138Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Continue Video Editor for The Decentraland Report","abstract":"As our previous Approved Grant, we would like to continue to produce content for Decentraland and request funds. this time to produce 36 more videos \n\nThe previous grant requested funds for 10 videos, from which we were actually able to produce 20 videos, releasing 2 videos per week. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmnqSRvd6bbJgmlS6A8BNw\n\nWe would like to ensure we can continue to publish content twice a week for the remainder of the year (18 more weeks in 2021, total of 36 videos)\n\nAs the previous grant, we would request $50/video, which equals $1,800 in MANA.\n\nThank you for continuing to support what we do at The Decentraland Report to record and publish the story we are creating together!","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA","size":1800,"beneficiary":"0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406","description":"In our last grant we requested grant funding to cover 10 videos for The Decentraland Report, this was to be over the course of 5 weeks.

However, the initial tiers are insufficient for larger scope projects. Meanwhile, projects like [Decentral Games](http://decentral.games) were born out of a larger grant that gave them the resources to create an MVP attracting angel and institutional capital. \n\nThis new tier would use the DAO to fund pre-existing teams building play-to-earn games in Decentraland. Many such teams exist, but it's up to the DAO and the community to attract them to the platform through funding, support, and guidance.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThe most engaging scenes are mid-sized games. Without a clear path for small teams to finance and launch an MVP of their project on Decentraland, the talent will flock to other metaverses.\n\nDue to the success of Axie Infinity, many teams want to build play-to-earn games. Decentraland is well-equipped to host these, with a fully-fledged SDK, a vibrant community, and an integration with Polygon enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers of digital assets.\n\nWith a small investment, the Decentraland community could give rise to numerous games of the caliber of [WonderMine](https://wondermine.wonderzone.io/), Decentral Games, and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/).\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\n**The new grant category would consist of:**\n\n* $30k USD (in MANA) / month, for 3 months\n\n**What are play-to-earn games?**\n\nThis new tier may only play-to-earn games. The MVPs must:\n\n1. Be an interactive game\n2. Feature on-chain assets (fungible and/or non-fungible tokens)\n3. Give users the ability to earn on-chain assets by playing the game\n\nAfter 1.5 months, recipients should provide an MVP: an interactive scene with a functional play-to-earn mechanic. The DAO will review these MVPs, voting on whether or not to execute the third payment.\n\n**Mentorship**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could curate a list of mentors who would be able to coach recipients through the grant‚Äôs duration.\n\n**LAND**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could help pair recipients with LAND owners.\n\n**Applications**\n\nTeams will use an extension of the existing DAO grants form to apply. Additional requirements include:\n\n\n* 1 page document summarizing the proposed game and its play-to-earn mechanic\n\nThis new tier may only be applied for in the last month of each quarter. Applications will only be accepted for one week, once per quarter.\n\nThe DAO would vote on each applicant. The three teams receiving the most VP would be selected, with a min of 2 million VP needed.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n* **Q3 2021**\n* **Aug**\n* Begin accepting applications by 8/26\n* **Sep**\n* Applications close 9/2\n* Winners announced 9/9\n* First payment by 9/13\n* **Q4 2021**\n* **Oct**\n* MVP by end of October\n* DAO votes to continue funding\n* Second payment pending DAO approval\n* **Nov**\n* Third payment\n\n**Reporting**\n\nThe DAO Committee and Facilitator would be responsible for monitoring progress, providing public reports every 2 weeks.\n\n**BENEFITS**\n\n* Attracts talented and experienced teams to Decentraland\n* Creates content that will help to boost Decentraland's attractiveness and retention\n* Attract capital to invest in Decentraland experiences","choices":["For: Approve the addition of the play-to-earn grant tier","Against: Reject the addition of the play-to-earn grant tier","Other: Revise the structure and terms of the play-to-earn tier"]},"discourse_topic_id":1870,"scores_total":7865422,"votes":46,"manaVP":1412532,"landVP":5916000,"namesVP":94600,"delegatedVP":442290,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"866278e0-ffc6-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b","snapshot_id":"QmXT9CbsvM4nLqQKaejAu6cKrarKbvXbFJbPLgjkV9Uw8W","user":"0x02493e5097b4241380736ec7a1407ec80af7d210","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 44,101 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-08-18T01:49:00.814Z","finish_at":"2021-08-25T01:49:00.814Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":44,"y":101,"description":"Satoshi Enterprises is an up and coming art gallery & entertainment venue which has the goal to fully incorporate many of the cool features DCL has to offer, including wearables, virtual meet & greets + live music events and more.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1859,"scores_total":83817,"votes":12,"manaVP":54117,"landVP":28000,"namesVP":1700,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b","snapshot_id":"QmaKPDGhgqXicEqFakaQpRBhMrjtuzKWh4PcBg6n1YmSPi","user":"0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397","type":"poll","title":"Should the Curation Committee receive a Compensation for their work?

These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The \"handing off\" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.\n\nIn order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.\n\n\n**Approach**\n\nPeople who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.\n\nI suggest that each committee member be compensated with 10% of the publication fee (50 MANA) per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1st.\n\nAccording to [this query](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet?query=Totals) on the Graph, the committee has published **227 separate collections** for a total of **466 items** since the launch of the Wearables Editor on **June 1, 2021** (as of the time of writing on August 12th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.\n\nWith the publication fee set at **500 MANA per item**, the DAO has collected **233,000 MANA** between June 1st and August 12th.\n\nDuring the previous 73 days, this averages to:\n\n* 1 collection / day / committee member\n* 2.13 items / day / committee member\n\nAt the suggested rate of 50 MANA/item/committee member, **each member would receive a rough average of 3,195 MANA / month.**\n\n**Benefit**\n\nBasing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:\n\n* Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient.\n* The data that each month‚Äôs compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community.\n* Starting at 50 MANA per creates incentives to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed.","choices":["Compensate Curators 50 MANA per item","Compensate Curators, but find another rate"]},"discourse_topic_id":1822,"scores_total":3176914,"votes":21,"manaVP":357189,"landVP":2488000,"namesVP":16700,"delegatedVP":315025,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"4a4ede00-fa37-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258","snapshot_id":"QmWepZNAKeo4978G7vBUzTf814QL4svjLYQ5HEzXQ4CJDy","user":"0x5ecbb84586747cf5cb280b33a95bfbabc54a6ea6","type":"poll","title":"Interaccion real.","start_at":"2021-08-11T00:01:00.176Z","finish_at":"2021-08-18T00:01:00.176Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"finished","configuration":{"title":"Interaccion real.","description":"uso de telefonos dentro del metaverso, manejo de automoviles con posibilidad de recoger usuarios o dar servicios a la comunidad, oferta y demanda de productos, publicidad , oportuniades, eventos en directo etc etc.. a que esperamos?? solo hay que plasmar la vida real.","choices":["apoyo el proyecto","no comparto"]},"discourse_topic_id":1790,"scores_total":2544,"votes":4,"manaVP":344,"landVP":2000,"namesVP":200,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"22a99340-f64f-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258","snapshot_id":"QmTm8fa9TGXsvrjtTe1cBNFFR6eq7YDthxb9wdyd1PBw9t","user":"0xdede2d81bed45b3ead9ead6ceec7ff08c76e404e","type":"poll","title":"Add \"Buy LAND/Collectables with Credit Card, ACH or Bank Account\" Feature","start_at":"2021-08-06T00:42:00.932Z","finish_at":"2021-08-13T00:42:00.932Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Add \"Buy LAND/Collectables with Credit Card, ACH or Bank Account\" Feature","description":"Ability for users to buy LAND/Collectables with Credit Card, ACH or Bank Account in a regulated, easy to use manner.","choices":["Yes","No"]},"discourse_topic_id":1745,"scores_total":1094905,"votes":25,"manaVP":124105,"landVP":642000,"namesVP":14200,"delegatedVP":314600,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"7aa9b8b0-f64d-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258","snapshot_id":"QmdinTN4BkSdHJ3djkdjGe8u7osJBvP6Z3UnvrFBFhSWNW","user":"0x135b17eaa25e3e0f3ce8f0a575bcc8867031f77c","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 9,-36 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-08-06T00:30:00.579Z","finish_at":"2021-08-13T00:30:00.579Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":9,"y":-36,"description":"Parallel Thought is a 42 LAND conceptual installation/NFT gallery that uses space to test the experiential boundaries of the meta-verse.

Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.\n\n### Approach\n\nPeople who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.\n\nI suggest that each committee member be compensated at an initial rate of $30 USD per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they‚Äôve done since June 1.\n\nAccording to this query on the Graph, the committee has published 135 separate collections for a total of 299 items since the launch of the Wearables Editor on June 1, 2021 (as of the time of writing on July 15th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.\n\nWith the publication fee set at 500 MANA per item, the DAO has collected 149,500 MANA between June 1 and July 15.\n\nDuring the previous 45 days, this averages to:\n\n- 1 collection / day / committee member\n- 2.21 items / day / committee member\n\nAt the suggested rate of $30 USD/item/committee member, each member would receive a rough average of $1989 USD / month (based on the previous 45 days worth of data).\n\n### Benefit\n\nBasing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:\n\n- Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient\n- The data that each month‚Äôs compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community\n- Starting at $30 USD per item leaves room to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed","choices":["Compensate Curators -  30 USD p/item","Compensate Curators - Find another rate","No compensation for Curators"]},"discourse_topic_id":1684,"scores_total":623878,"votes":18,"manaVP":5767,"landVP":274000,"namesVP":10400,"delegatedVP":333710,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"3a1dbab0-f2a3-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258","snapshot_id":"QmP3bTccWwg93VLwg85gPfmSUHyzbGU5YcC7d4zb7opaWU","user":"0x3f43e5d0a148e440a53ae601ab24c63b06f10e30","type":"poll","title":"Play to earn Mechanics!","start_at":"2021-08-01T08:34:00.355Z","finish_at":"2021-08-08T08:34:00.355Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Play to earn Mechanics!","description":"Add an in-game coin you can earn by logging in,  visting locations , other daily objectives which can be exchanged for mana OR nft marketplace items.

After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\n          The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event.

Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1. City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely ‚Äúwired‚Äú from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2. Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3. User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

Each land or parcel could host different boards, levels and tracks. We could build stadiums where we congregate to watch. DCL members could form leagues, for example Tuesday night Goldeneye league where teams of 4 have already paid their league fee, say 100 mana for 8 weeks where the teams compete for prizes (NFTS, crypto) . Audience members can wager on the outcomes. Additionally individual users can wager crypto against each other whenever leagues aren't active. High scores can be dominantly displayed for bragging rights but also as a challenge to others. I also believe that this  will lead to a NFT explosion as they would give you an actual perk/powerup in the game. for example say a skull shifter on your kart in the race that give you a banana every lap. this makes a very prominent USE case for NFTS beyond looking cool.

(Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the DAO's [vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding  decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO. \n\nAs of the time this proposal was published, `30,578,217` of that MANA has vested, and is now available to the DAO's treasury.\n\nIt is risky for the DAO to keep only MANA (its native governance token) in its treasury. To help guarantee that the treasury's balance remains wisely managed, the DAO's treasury should diversify across bluechip assets (e.g. ETH or BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI or USDC), and other assets such as a DeFi index (DPI) which may enable the DAO to earn yield. \n\nSpreading the DAO's holdings across these different assets will help to stabilize the DAO's entire treasury in the face of market fluctuations.\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community, e.g. grants. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) specifies that each grant is to be paid in MANA, according to the exchange rate between USD and MANA at the time of the transaction. \n\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n_**In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/5th of its treasury (or `6,115,643` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI. **_\n\nThe remaining 4/5ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n**Specification**\n\n1/5th of the DAO's existing treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, with to the following distribution:\n\n* `2,038,547.66` USDC\n* `2,038,547.66` USDT\n* `2,038,547.66` DAI\n\nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig, requiring the signature of all three members.\n\n**For**\n\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n**Against**\n\nReject the proposed asset allocation.","choices":["For","Against"]},"discourse_topic_id":1368,"scores_total":5734416,"votes":18,"manaVP":2204416,"landVP":3530000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"69061530-de48-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372","snapshot_id":"QmYjaKUA8WQams4SQzpsgY8MNTvua3gLeobjQD1GbsSU83","user":"0xeb277c1eee99139d7ccb9b9bf4e9002ab7ab4ebf","type":"poll","title":"Land Ownership Titles","start_at":"2021-07-06T10:53:00.595Z","finish_at":"2021-07-13T10:53:00.595Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Land Ownership Titles","description":"you agree to implement distinctive titles for landowners.\nfor example :\n1 Land - Lord\n4 Land - Knight\n10 Land - Baron\n25 Land - Duke\n100 Land - Emperor\n\nThe avatar could carry the name, its title.

This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n\n##### Text Displaying Types \n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.  \n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.  \n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".

What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","personnel":"I already have one successful approved grant with delivered content.

The poll received **68% (4,322,367 VP) voting YES** (in support of VP delegation) and **32% (2,065,731 VP) voting NO** (in opposition to VP delegation). [You can view the original poll here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=fc6f60a0-bdb5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)\n\nHowever, due to the subsequent debate within the community, the DAO Committee recommended postponing the activation of VP delegation to allow for continued discussion. The Committee also called for the creation of a summary of the pros and cons of VP delegation to help inform voters leading up to this second, and final, poll in the DAO deciding whether or not to activate VP delegation.\n\nPlease carefully review this [report on the potential impacts of VP delegation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idxYsKqnpwH5IuwiCNE5Wu3AwXqGTNzilyqjK5M-S5Q/edit?usp=sharing) before casting your vote.\n\n**Specification**\n\nActivating VP delegation in Decentraland‚Äôs Snapshot Space would allow users to delegate their voting power to any address in one of two ways:\n\n1. Via Snapshot‚Äôs UI at **[https://snapshot.page/#/delegate](https://snapshot.page/#/delegate)**\n2. With a smart contract by calling the ‚ÄòsetDelegate‚Äô method\n\nDelegating VP in Snapshot requires an on-chain Ethereum transaction, which incurs a gas fee.\n\nVP delegation in Snapshot is not transitive, and a user who has delegated VP to another wallet can still vote with their own VP on any proposal at any time.\n\nMore details on how delegation is implemented in Snapshot can be found in the [Snapshot documentation](https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation).\n\n**Benefits**\n\n\n\n* Helps to mitigate the risks of voting with LAND stored in cold (hardware) wallets\n* Allows LAND stored in smart contracts to contribute VP to votes\n* Allows users to empower trusted subject matter experts\n\n**Risks**\n\n\n\n* Increases the risk that VP will be bought and sold\n* Concentrates VP to a smaller number of wallets, increasing the risk of making difficult-to-reverse decisions\n* Increases the risks of community grants fraud\n\n**For**\n\nActivate VP delegation in Decentraland‚Äôs Snapshot Space\n\n**Against**\n\nDo not activate VP delegation in Decentraland‚Äôs Snapshot Space","choices":["For","Against"]},"discourse_topic_id":1310,"scores_total":4663373,"votes":30,"manaVP":987373,"landVP":3676000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"d896b630-d9f6-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b","snapshot_id":"Qme38YRM2bZwSuhk9Axs8hUEbP4B9gKcu3wcLEAZNmPPCL","user":"0x6a75ac02b0a2f8e016ffda57611540022e5f1e6d","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name JewFucker","start_at":"2021-06-30T22:59:00.387Z","finish_at":"2021-07-07T22:59:00.387Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"name":"JewFucker","description":"No need to elaborate.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.  \n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in. \n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.    \n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.","specification":"This project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control \nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) \nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.  \n\n##### Scene Add/remove\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here \n\n[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.","personnel":"### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here [https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.  \nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27  \n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.

Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2","roadmap":"### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1194,"scores_total":1198561,"votes":36,"manaVP":876561,"landVP":322000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"d0a802a0-d378-11eb-987d-410735a966ad","snapshot_id":"QmcEtXsQLg9nY3ACAPFivBrHMTZo1KpKF1niFsJYrF5Br6","user":"0x6411a6771684e0b8535b57e64fb81d1a7facea07","type":"grant","title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","start_at":"2021-06-22T16:42:00.514Z","finish_at":"2021-06-29T16:42:00.514Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","abstract":"I want to start a youtube channel, of motor biking, showing the beauty of North-east India.

This is not a major issue however the further behind the builder gets the more issues may appear between what you see in Builder and what you see when deployed.\n\nFor example introduced in 6.6.4 there was a backwards breaking change.  \"There used to be a gimbal lock problem where going from Quaternion > Euler wasn't a symmetric conversion, so if you converted quaternion to euler and back you might not have the same angle\".

So what do you do?\n\nWell, since name NFT owners have passed a vote to get voting points and landowners have voting power privileges - Why do wearables owners not have that?\n\nThe only reason that I can think of is that future L2 wearables minted on MATIC may be minted for a very low cost per NFT so those would not be a great measure of how invested their owners are in the game. This would incentivize spam wearables just to get VP. So that is out of the question, - for now. Future L2 MATIC wearables will not be included in this initiative.\n\nBut ETH Layer 1 wearables have a fixed supply (except for a few rewards still outstanding) and are well distributed across the community.

Currently, all of the LAND parcels that make up public roads within Decentraland are owned by the Decentraland DAO. Only the DAO has the permissions to deploy content to these parcels.\n\nBy authorizing an externally owned account (EOA) operated by the Decentraland Foundation to become an \"update manager\" of the DAO's LAND and Estates, the Foundation would be able to deploy content and experiences for everyone to enjoy.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nEnabling the Decentraland Foundation to deploy content to public road parcels provides several benefits:\n\n* Public events are increasing in popularity, boosted by the content built by the Decentraland Foundation.

Increasing the LAND available to the Foundation would increase the reach and impact of these events.\n* Specifically, the Decentraland Foundation is hosting a Pride Parade in June to celebrate and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people and communities. As with physical Pride Parades, Decentraland's parade should be held on public roads. The Foundation needs access to these parcels to deploy the floats and decorations for the event.\n* In addition to events, the Decentraland Foundation can use these deployment permissions to keep public roads up-to-date with interesting and engaging content.\n* An example of another feature that the Foundation could deploy on roads is a tram system linking the major areas of the map. This tram system has already been built, and only needs to be deployed to public roads to make it available.

After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.\n\nHowever, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.\n\n**This introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:**\n\n* A high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators\n* The Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform\n* When exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered\n* Other dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users\n\nGiven the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. *This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.*\n\nThis fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.\n\n**These fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.**\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* Disincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published\n* Promotes the submission of very high quality wearables\n* Protects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables\n\n**Specification**\n\nEach time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item. These fees are charged per item in a collection, not per NFT minted from an item.\n\nFor example, if an X MANA fee is approved by the DAO, the fees would be as follows.\n\n* 1 Unique item - 1 NFT - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Mythic Item - 10 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Legendary Item - 100 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Epic item - 1000 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA","choices":["100 MANA","500 MANA","Other"]},"discourse_topic_id":926,"scores_total":6194760,"votes":74,"manaVP":2092760,"landVP":4102000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"b7b295c0-c154-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301","snapshot_id":"QmYTGE2N2YJu3hKUVabvwuPUUdoYbc9xytUjiEX2u2fgqm","user":"0xa5e2bb97de3c62ca06f1a2293eb7e01c114e9a49","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 26,9 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-05-30T14:38:00.828Z","finish_at":"2021-06-06T14:38:00.828Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":26,"y":9,"description":"Add The Free TON HQ, built by DC Metaverse Studio as a point of interest in Decentraland.\n\nFree TON is a blockchain platform created by the developers of the Telegram Open Network (TON).\n\nLearn more https://freeton.org/discover","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":907,"scores_total":549459,"votes":11,"manaVP":159459,"landVP":390000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"39ace280-c045-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301","snapshot_id":"QmSaMCEwE9nx4uBeSpJk4aG6gxFeDF1ADbAodntRy3Tenw","user":"0x95a40112c37d79f6833935ec780495d5d3e23178","type":"poll","title":"Transfer Ownership of MANA-BNT Bancor Pool to the Bancor DAO","start_at":"2021-05-29T06:15:00.784Z","finish_at":"2021-06-05T06:15:00.784Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Transfer Ownership of MANA-BNT Bancor Pool to the Bancor DAO","description":"The Bancor DAO is looking to raise the Co-Investment limit of the MANA-BNT pool to open up space for LPs on the MANA side to stake their tokens single sided with Impermanent Loss Protection.

(100 VP per name owned).","description":"Hello community,\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: \nI propose this question with complete transparency that I own 100+ names myself and have a bias to this proposal. With that being disclosed, lets get to the details!\n\n**PROPOSAL**:\nNAME owners receive 100 VP per name owned. Just as MANA holders receive 1 for 1 VP per MANA, NAME holders (who put their MANA to work and also burn it out of existence) should receive 1 for 1 VP proportional to the cost of minting a name.\n\n**BACKGROUND**: \nCurrent DAO participants are MANA holders and LAND holders. LAND owners being granted 2,000 VP per land and MANA holders a 1 for 1 VP per MANA. As it shows, NAME owners currently hold no VP even though contributions to acquire names are arguably the most contributory to the state of Decentraland between the 3; minting a name requires the cost of 100 MANA (which is burnt out of existence!) as well as gas fees, which we all know can be outrageous at times. \n\nI will spare you all the argument of whether or not the minting cost of names should be lowered or not, but I will point out that compared to acquiring LAND, minting a name is dirt cheap. Not only does owning a NAME differentiate you from the flurry of \"User#1fj49\" Metaversers that populate Decentraland, but it is also a domain name -- which can be attached to a parcel (and a 1/1 NFT)!  I am not proposing this question as a means of adding extra utility to make my name investments sell better, but rather give those who do not have thousands of MANA to acquire LAND and also wish to have a unique identity in the next frontier of the internet, a say in how Decentraland progresses.\n\nGiven the recent major developments from the Decentraland dev team in how the DAO operates, I believe it will serve the community well to allow more members to participate in the direction of Decentraland. Since I joined the community a few months ago, I have learned that Decentraland is filled with so many helpful people -- whether it be a newcomer who has a plethora of questions, an up and coming NFT artist who is debuting their work, I have seen more examples than I can count with my fingers of instances of community members going out of their way to show support! Lets try and put more power into the little guys' hands that weren't here on Launch Day, but want to participate and don't have to feel like they are going against all odds when voting versus massive whales that can influence an entire vote themselves.","choices":["YES","NO"]},"discourse_topic_id":836,"scores_total":1677917,"votes":64,"manaVP":1017917,"landVP":660000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null},{"id":"4ae3d530-bce5-11eb-9ce9-917c8b726149","snapshot_id":"QmfZ4C2GFMUfGiqZWwnCMZvhcHLC7wuRVUkWr6ATvJqQbr","user":"0x9d3bb66715db47f87fc70ed66cf2460b2121bdc0","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -59,-46 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-05-24T23:10:00.492Z","finish_at":"2021-05-31T23:10:00.492Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-59,"y":-46,"description":"This land is devoted to the advancement of Ethermon project and creative NFT's for sale.

However, when users are buying claimed names from Decentraland Marketplace or secondary marketplaces like Opensea then they might find a name they want but the characterisation is messy and not clean.
